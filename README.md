# doticu-npc-party
A follower framework for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

## Features:
- the power to enlist any humaniod npc (other creatures may come later)
- the ability to clone any humaniod npc (to avoid conflicts with other scripts)
- every member can be made to settle in another part of the game world
- any member can be made completely immobile, so they never go anywhere
- members can be a warrior, a mage, an archer, or classless (other classes may come later)
- each member can be made successively immortal or kept as mortal and resurrectable
- vampires can enthrall members (making them a vampire in their clan may come later)
- a comprehensive dialogue menu to manage each individual member
- an exhaustive MCM menu to manage all members and settings
