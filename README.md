# doticu-npc-party
*A follower framework for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition that allows you to manage and keep track of a thousand NPCs.*

It can be tough to manage all my followers, as I always end up getting a lot of them. It's hard to know: who is a follower, how many do I have, how can I easily switch one out for another, where can I find them, and why can't I have more? In order to handle all the followers, I knew I needed to use a follower framework, a mod that manages multiple followers at a time. But what mods are available? How many do they allow? How well do they manage my followers? And to what extent? With all the quirks of managing, outfitting, cloning, resurrecting, and more, I realized that I really wanted something that can handle a *lot* of followers. So I set out to make:

# *NPC Party*

- **displayed** on command
- and they **level** as you level

## Requires
- [Skyrim SE 1.5.97+](https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/)
- [SKSE 2.0.17+](https://skse.silverlock.org/)
- [SkyUI 5.2SE+](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604)

# 
## Members and Followers
A member is an NPC that is managed by the framework, and a follower is an active member who will travel with you and fight for you. You can have up to 1024 members and 16 followers at a time. Whenever you please, you can switch out followers for other members by using the MCM menu. No longer will you have to go searching for a lost follower! It's as easy as clicking a few buttons and they will come to you.

# 
## Clones
Cloning NPCs allows for less conflicts with other mods and even vanilla Skyrim. Though a clone can still cause conflicts, by using them this framework changes more while altering original NPCs less. Additionally, cloning an exact lookalike of a generic NPC, such as a town guard or bandit, is now possible. Cloning gives you more stable followers and copies of NPCs, whether they be unique or generic, friend or foe.

# 
## Packs and Outfits
It is frustrating when follower's randomly add items to their inventory, or when they equip things you only want them to carry. With NPC Party, each member has a separate pack, which acts as their inventory, and they never equip anything inside it. They have several outfits on the side, which will not randomly fill up with junk. Each member will consistently wear what you tell them to. Optionally their outfits can be filled with equipment, or start out empty. You may also have members automatically change their outfit depending on their role. Both original and cloned NPCs within the framework have their own pack and outfits, so there's no cross-contamination. Only items that are in each individual outfit are equipped, while the items in their pack remain untouched.

# 
## Style and Vitality
Followers can be styled as a warrior, a mage, an archer, a coward, or fight however they choose. A follower's style effects their in-game attributes and skills as well as what weapons they are most likely to use. Vitality is the state of their vulnerability in combat. If they are mortal they may die at the hands of your enemies. Protected status shields them from outright death, except should you be the one to deal the final blow. Essential status will keep even you from killing them, but they will take a knee when they run out of health. And Invulnerable status speaks for itself. Style and Vitality gracefully allow you to change how your followers handle combat and allow you to get the most out of your members.

# 
## Beta
This mod is currently in beta testing. You may run into a few hiccups every now and then, including slow execution, unpolished features, unexpected behaviors, and sometimes even outright bugs. I hope to resolve any issues and bring the mod out of beta into version 1.0.0. Mid-game updates are supported in the mod and will be the usual method. But sometimes updating may require a fresh save game. Also, there is currently no uninstall feature. Just uninstalling the mod is not the end of one's save game, but it will leave behind data that is no longer in use.

# 
## Compatibility
One of the goals of this mod was to touch as few vanilla assets as possible, but no promises can be made regarding compatibility. Currently, the vanilla follower system has been disabled, and the consequences have not been fully tested. There will be issues with other full-scale follower frameworks being used at the same time. Custom followers who use the vanilla system will need to use the framework. If they don't use the vanilla system, they may be fully compatible alongside the framework. Outfitting mods are compatible when using a member's "Vanilla" outfit.

# 
## Conclusion
I hope that this mod changes your follower experience for the better. My goal was to spend less time dilly dallying with obscure issues in the follower system, vanilla or modded, and to enjoy the game with as many followers as I want to. I wish the same for you. Whether you want to have one cherished follower who defines your journey, or amass a cult following of NPCs to do your every whim, whether you want to have mortal followers who can truly die, or a team of invincible power-houses to rock the world, whether you want them to wear armor, or no armor, whether you want them to carry all your items, or nothing at all, whether you want to rename them, clone them, resurrect them, or even just move them out of the way when they are blocking a door, I hope this mod benefits you. Thank you for playing NPC Party!
