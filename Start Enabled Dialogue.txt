                Ah, a student of the craft. You'll need to start by learning an enchantment.
                Take an enchanted weapon or piece of armor, then use the Arcane Enchanter to learn its secrets. The item is destroyed in the process, so be wary.
                Once you know an enchantment, you'll need a filled soul gem, and something to enchant. You'll use the Arcane Enchanter for that, too.
                Of course, I have everything you need for sale, if you have the coin.

                A little Wheat and Blisterwort makes a healing potion, if you didn't know.

                I've written some letters and placed them in a satchel. Perhaps you wouldn't mind delivering it to them on my behalf?

                I had a bad fall in the mine when I was bringing some food to the men.
                I was pretty bad off for a while, but a priest of Mara was passing through on his way to Dawnstar and healed me to the best of his abilities.
                I'm still pretty sore and can't really walk too far without having to rest for a while.

                Not much, I'm afraid. It was named Kahvozein's Fang after the dragon worshipped by this particular sect of the cult.
                They were said to be quite fond of ritual sacrifices. So fond, in fact, that the high priest spent a great deal of time sharpening the dagger.
                That way it was always ready for the next inevitable victim.

                As I've said, I made some progress using the essence of dragon scales. But they're just not quite potent enough.
                My knowledge of Skyrim's history is far from complete, but I did some research and discovered two things.
                First, there are ancient references to dragon "heartscales". What little I could learn suggests they may be what I need.
                Second, there are stories of a dagger called Kahvozein's Fang, said to be sharp enough to carve individual scales off a dragon.
                First you'll need to retrieve the dagger, then use it to carve a few scales off a dragon. Presumably a deceased one.

                Not just any dragon scales. Heartscales. Very special.
                You'll need Kahvozein's Fang, of course.
                Then, if you should happen upon the corpse of a dragon, you should be able to use it to slice off a heartscale or two.
                Even just one should be enough for me to complete my research.

                Light, medium, or heavy?

                Light armor for scouting detail, heavy armor for full on combat, or something in between?

                You should probably be in bed. You're looking a bit under the weather.

                I'm told they're the ravings of a madman... a wizard named Arondil and his peculiar cravings.
                It's said to be spread across four volumes and very hard to come by. My client is offering quite a reward for them, which I'd split with you.

                Then we have a deal.
                In his later years, Andoril moved into some ice caves known as Yngvild. He prefered the solitude in which to perform his, um... experiments.

            topic_info: 000A3120 
                It's a good start, but you need all four of the volumes or the set isn't complete.
                Why don't you head back out to Yngvild and find the rest?

                Recently, a woman was found... naked and shivering along the road to Dawnstar.
                The only information the guard could get from her were tales of strange experiments and Arondil scribbling in his journals.

                Only rumors. He used to have a home in Dawnstar until they burned it down.
                The people say he was doing unspeakable experiments on reanimation... rituals only a necromancer would perform.
                After he made for Yngvild, he was never heard from again.

                You've been a beacon of hope in these dark times for my people and I will never forget it.
                Therefore, by my authority as Jarl, I pronounce you Thane of Riften and award you all of the benefits befitting your station. Congratulations.

                I expect that you'll distance yourself from the affairs of state. In other words, keep your nose out of my business and we'll do just fine.

                I guess all that's left is to bestow the title. What were those words again?

                Before I can present you with the title, there's but a single requirement you must fulfill.
                A Thane of Riften is expected to maintain permanent residence within the city walls.
                My steward has such a home available to you for purchase. I think you'll find the accommodations to be most pleasing.
                When the house is yours, return to me and I will present you the title.

                Not so fast, there's a matter of residence to be discussed.
                In order to have the title bestowed upon you, you need to purchase a house within Riften.
                And by the Eight, aren't you fortunate that my steward has just the place for you to buy.
                After the place is yours, come back to me and we'll deal with the rest of the nonsense.

                If you think you can steal my throne by winning the hearts of the people, that's where you're wrong. Keep that in mind.
                However, since it wouldn't behoove me to make you disappear, I'd rather have you on my side as Thane of Riften.

                Items? What items? Let me see those.
                Hmm. I'm not sure how you managed it, but these are exactly what I need to start my next set of experiments. Wonderful!

                Yes, I could use some help with that. An assistant perhaps? No, no, no. Maybe a familiar. No, too messy.
                Well, at any rate, organization is not my strong suit. Not at all. I need as much help as I can get.
                In fact, if you could retrieve a few things for me, I could start on my next set of experiments.

                As you can imagine, I tend to forget things often. Leave things around. I really must learn to put these things away.
                What I need is my Dwemer Stirring Spoon, my Orichalcum Ingot and my Grand Soul Gem. In fact, I could use them immediately.
                Bring those items back to me and I'll be happy to experiment on you. No, no... that isn't right. I'd be happy to reward you.

                Let's see. Last time I used the Dwemer Spoon was at my dear friend Boti's house in Ivarstead... Fellstar Farm I believe it's called.
                The orichalcum ingot should still be in Winterhold at the Frozen Hearth Inn. I don't know why I didn't just take it with me.
                And last is the soul gem. I left that one in Windhelm at the White Phial alchemy shop. It was a good trade too. Ah well.

                A Priest of Arkay is entrusted with a ceremonial dagger once they've completed their training.
                It usually given by the head priest who sanctified the ritual. In my case, the head priest happened to be my father.
                The thing is, I never wanted to follow in his footsteps... I some ways I still don't.

                I had to for honor's sake, but I had waited too long. My father died before he could see my training to completion.
                When I finally became a priest, they gave me the new high priest's dagger, but I already owned my father's.
                So you see, I have to return it. It breaks tradition, and I need to tell him that I finally did what he wanted.

                Do you know she's slept with three different men in the last month alone? What kind of a woman would do such a thing?

                You see, I happen to know after she makes love, she gives her partner a token of her affection called a Mark of Dibella.
                If you confront her with three of the Marks, she'd be so embarrassed... well, I don't know what she'd do!

                You need to get the Marks of Dibella from Bolli, Hofgrir and Indaryn. Not sure how you're going to do that, but try your best.

                Private Morrard... Angela's daughter was in that scouting party. She needs to be told.

                She just wouldn't hear it.
                It was brave of you to come to me with this. I can't thank you for it, not for this, but you have done me a service.

            topic_info: 000E8276 
                It is called "Force" in your tongue. But as you push the world, so does the world push back.
                Think of the way force may be applied effortlessly. Imagine but a whisper pushing aside all in its path.
                That is "Fus." Let its meaning fill you. Su'um ahrk morah. You will push the world harder than it pushes back.

            topic_info: 000E8274 
                "Fade" in your tongue. Mortals have greater affinity for this Word than the dov. Everything mortal fades away in time, but the spirit remains.
                Ponder the meaning of spirit. Unslaad zii. Where mortal flesh may wither and die, the spirit endures.
                That is "Feim." Let that meaning fill you. Su'um ahrk morah. You will find that your spirit will give you more strength.

            topic_info: 000E8275 
                In your tongue, the Word simply means "Fire." It is change given form. Power at its most primal.
                That is the true meaning of "Yol." Suleyk. Power. You have it, as do all dov. But power is inert without action and choice.
                Think of this as the fire builds in your su'um, in your breath. Su'um ahrk morah. What will you burn? What will you spare?

                But no, Dovahkiin. Others do not come here to train anymore. Saraan. You are the first in over a hundred years.
                I meditate on the Rotmulaag - the Words of Power. I counsel in their use. It is enough for me.

                Knowing a Word of Power is to take its meaning into yourself. 
                Contemplate the meaning of a Rotmulaag. You will become closer to that Word, as it fills your inner self.
                Will I teach you, Dovahkiin? What Word calls you to deeper understanding? There are three to master: Fus, Feim, and Yol.

                You have learned so much already, Dragonborn. Growing your gift too quickly would be dangerous.
                But there are many Words of Power in Skyrim, carved in the Dragon tongue. Even from here, we can feel the Thu'um resonate from them.
                Finding these lost Words would be a sufficient test, to temper your abilities with experience. Ask when you are ready to search.

                You're in luck. There is a blessing the Blades used on the eve of battle. It's supposed to prepare the mind for slaying dragons.

                I am. The Blades of the 2nd Era hunted down many dragons in their day, and they have records of where the beasts lived.
                Only you can truly defeat these monsters, Dragonborn, but you do not have to do so alone. The Blades can help you.
                Just ask whenever you're ready to take on a dragon. We will send the Blades to help you fulfill your destiny.

                Remember, though, being a Blade is a lifelong commitment. Their loyalty has to be with us once they're in.

                As a matter of fact, there are. Have you ever heard of Shalidor?
                Immensely powerful mage, back in the First Era. Had an understanding of magic few have ever matched.
                He holed himself up in Labyrinthian, and devoted all of his time to research and study. Wrote more than you would imagine possible.
                Since then, his writings have been scattered all over Skyrim, but are little use to anyone who can't translate them. I'm one of the few who can.

                The ancients built many of the fortresses that dot the landscape of Skyrim.
                Sadly, most have fallen into disrepair. And nearly all have been overrun with bandits or other vagabonds. 
                Fort Hraagstad is one of the few that remains mostly intact.

                Not sure I understand the question. The Legion's always been in Skyrim. 
                We have garrisons throughout all the provinces of the Empire. Our mission is to serve the Emperor, uphold the law, and protect the citizenry.
                Skyrim's days are darkening, and the Legion will soon be called into service like never before. But we stand ready, as always, to meet that call.
            topic_info: 000D3C56 
                At first they called us that to belittle our cause. But we gladly accept being named for Ulfric Stormcloak, the only true High King of Skyrim.
                We are the true sons and daughters of Skyrim, and Ulfric... he's the truest of us all.
                We fight to make our land great once more, to raise up strong, noble thanes, and lay low false Jarls and the cowards who hide behind them.
                The sound of our fury is a storm about to break on the heads of our enemies. Our friendship, a cloak of true brotherhood for all who would wear it.

                You mean Ulfric's so-called "Stormcloak rebellion"?
                The Nord kings - oh, excuse me, "Jarls" - they can't seem to control their own people. So the Legion has stepped in to keep order.
                Sadly, the Empire's stretched a little thin these days, and we've gotten very few reinforcements. So we've been forced to recruit locally.
                But rest assured, citizen. We'll put an end to this uprising... and things will get back to normal soon enough.
            topic_info: 000D3C5E 
                Skyrim is the birthplace of humanity. The birthplace of honor. And those snowbacked Imperials renounced both when they laid down before the Thalmor.
                Worse still, to pay for the privilege to keep his throne, the Emperor sells Skyrim and our very gods - Talos, no less! - to the damn elves.
                And what did Torygg do? He and the Jarls that supported him? They took the Emperor's gold. Sold out their people for a slave master's "peace treaty."
                Ulfric did right killing him. Soon we'll rid Skyrim of elves, their bloody Justiciars, and the Jarls in their pockets. The whole damn lot of them.
                And we'll cleave through the Legion to get to them.

                I'm not surprised you've never heard of it. Even I used to think it was just a myth.
                But not anymore. The Dragon War was a real event, although only the barest glimmer of the actual events has come down to us.
                Far back in the Mythic Era, the dragons were worshipped as gods in Skyrim.
                Many of the monumental ruins that still dot the landscape were, in fact, built as temples to the dragons.
                The details are lost, but at some point the Nords rebelled. After a long and terrible war, the Nords overthrew their dragon overlords.

                One sure mark of a fool is to dismiss anything that falls outside his experience as being impossible.

                These spells are difficult, even for one as skilled as I.
                To even begin to inscribe them, I need something very special. A sigil stone from an Oblivion gate.
                I do not have one in my possession. Nor do you, I'm sure. So we require a Daedra to retrieve one for us.
                You will summon a Dremora, and order it to bring a sigil stone to you. I will then inscribe the spells for you.

            topic_info: 000DB36D 
                I will teach you the spell to summon the Dremora, but know that it will only work in a place properly prepared for the event.
                Once you have summoned the Dremora, you will order it to deliver to you a sigil stone from an Oblivion gate.
                Once I have the sigil stone, I shall inscribe the spells that you seek.

                Summoning an Unbound Dremora is not like other Conjuration spells. It will not simply do your bidding.
                You must first prove you are in control.
                Here is the spell you need. Go to the top of the Hall of Attainment; I have prepared a place for you there.

                How quickly you've advanced. Most impressive.
                There are spells yet to be learned, powerful spells that can more closely and more permanently bind creatures to your will.
                But there are risks. There are always risks. You must summon and command an unbound Dremora.

                Born and raised right here in Rorikstead.
                My father was a soldier. He fought in the great war and when it was over, he retired here to raise a family. 
                My mother passed away when I was just a babe, so he did his best to raise me on his own.

                His name's Mralki, and he's the innkeeper here. I hope you can change his mind.

                I'm not forcing him to stay here. I know that he wants a life of adventure, but I've told him before that I can't afford to buy him armor.

                You have gone beyond my teachings, which is quite a feat. I did not think it possible.

                Knowledge of truly powerful Illusion spells is here at the College, but it is hidden from those who might misuse it.
                I shall teach you a spell to discern things hidden from others. With it, you will be able to acquire the texts you need.
                Bring all four to me, and I shall use them to inscribe the spells for you.

                I'm feeling a sense of inner peace... something I haven't felt in a very long time.
                Instead of being clouded with thoughts of revenge and retribution, I feel only serenity and fulfillment.
                Of course, I've been also dabbling in my old pastimes as well. Take a look around, and feel free to share the fruits of my labor.

                I think by now, most within the Guild are well aware of what transpired between Mercer Frey and ourselves.
                The notion that the Nightingales are a fictive group has long since passed.
                If you wish to wear your Nightingale Armor within the Guild, I'm certain that no one would give it a second thought.

                Take a good look around you! Have you ever see the Guild in such a prosperous state?
                With Mercer Frey gone and our influence present in all of Skyrim's cities, the Guild's accumulating wealth faster than we can spend it.
                I couldn't be more proud to be a part of the Thieves Guild, or its new Guild Master.

                It's as if the merchandise and coin are simply falling from the sky.
                Vex and Delvin are having to turn clients away at this point, it's almost impossible to keep up.

                This is the only thing I've ever found. I think it's better off in your hands.

                Not like that it isn't.
                The stone was pried off of Barenziah's ceremonial crown by a thief in order to cover his tracks.

                I think there were twenty-four in all. Most people keep them as a curiosity.
                Some of the Guild members have tried to locate them over the years, but they haven't been successful... well, until now.

                When I told you the set had to be complete, I left out a small detail... I honestly didn't think you'd ever get this far.
                If the stones were remounted on the crown, it would be of great benefit to the Thieves Guild.
        topic: 0009DFA9 TGCrownTurnInBranchTopic02
            topic_info: 0009DFBA 
                I have it on good authority that the crown is within Tolvald's Cave; dropped by a Dunmer caravan leaving Morrowind long ago.
                If you can bring it back, we could restore the paragon... and reap its benefits.
        topic: 0006D416 TGCrownTurnInBranchTopic03
            topic_info: 0006D480 
                Not exactly. The crown is what the Guild calls a paragon; an object that enhances our thieving abilities.
                At least, that's what I'm told it does... there hasn't been a paragon in this Guild for hundreds of years.
        topic: 0006D415 TGCrownTurnInBranchTopic04
            topic_info: 0006D43C 
                If we want to stay on top in Skyrim, the Guild needs that paragon back.
                Without it, we're just a bunch of petty thieves.

            topic_info: 0002C189 
                The cave has a bad history. Long ago, Potema the Wolf Queen used it for necromantic rituals. That's where it got the name.
                That was over 500 years ago. Nothing much down there now - but everyone's always convinced the cave is haunted.

                There have been reports of weird happenings near Wolfskull Cave. Travelers disappearing, odd lights. I suspect wild animals or perhaps bandits.
                I don't think it's worth our time with the war going on, but if you want to clear out the cave, I'll make sure you're repaid for your work.

                Although I have not practiced in a long time I was once a wizard. Even when I was young my magic was undeniably powerful.
                It was that power that brought me to the attention of the Thalmor. In the Summerset Isles it is a great honor to be chosen to serve the Thalmor.

                They are the governing council of the Aldmeri Dominion. They lead us to attack the Empire and forced the Empire to agree to stop worshiping Talos. 
                It was during the war with the Empire that I was at the height of my power. As a Thalmor battlemage I laid waste the enemy.
                Men, women, children, no one was spared my wrath. I destroyed whole villages.

                I wish more of our ranks asked such questions. 
                I've started seeing the Companions as a kind of family.
                I've battled next to every man and woman here, and the bonds of sweat are stronger than those of blood.
                I would trust anyone here with my life, which is more than I'd say for the milk drinkers who raised me.
            topic_info: 000DAB44 
                It means resting your haunches in Whiterun more than I'd care to, for one.
                But when it's time to draw blood, there's no one in Skyrim I'd rather have at my back.
                It means waking up every day knowing that you could die, and having to earn your life by clawing for every breath.
                I don't know how those cozy lords manage to drag themselves out of bed every day. Why bother if you're not living?

                I've never been a smart one. But the Companions welcome anyone with the heart of a warrior.
                When we step into battle, we fight for our own name, and the name of the Companions.
            topic_info: 000DAB46 
                There's been a group called the Companions for over 4000 years. It's been many different things in that time.
                A conquering army. Ruthless mercenaries. A band of drunken louts. And the esteemed company you see before you. 
                But there's always been a kind of honor to it. We don't deal in politics or underhanded sneaking. 
                We try to uphold the legacy of Ysgramor. To bear his good name such that it never be forgotten, and always be spoken with reverence.
            topic_info: 000DAB47 
                It means signing on for the Nord ideas of how to live your life. Honor, battle, glory, all that.
                "Even an elf can be born with the heart of a Nord," Skjor said when I joined. I think he meant it as a compliment.

                Just because you've been accepted here so quickly, don't think I'm going to help you rise any faster.
                Fight well, don't be a lout, and you'll be fine. You don't need my help.
            topic_info: 000DAB49 
                So much.
                This group... this family... this band... this is the best thing I've ever been a part of.
                The oldest fighting group in Skyrim, and nothing but glory from Ysgramor's day to our own.
                To be counted in that line is a bit of immortality. Even if I never see Sovngarde, I'll have that much.

                It means when I have troubles, I always have someone on my side.
                We have Shield-Siblings to keep our backs as dangerous as our fronts.

                Ask any fool around here, and get a different answer.
                Mercenaries. Warriors of honor. Brothers and sisters of the blade. Drunken rabble. Take your pick.
                I've been here longer than most of them. Even I don't know sometimes. I just hope they don't kill each other.
            topic_info: 000DAB37 
                An outsider, eh? Never heard of the Companions? 
                An order of warriors. We are brothers and sisters in honor. 
                And we show up to solve problems if the coin is good enough.
            topic_info: 000DAB38 
                The Companions are my family. We fight so that other people don't have to. 
                We bring honor and glory to ourselves and each other.
            topic_info: 000DAB39 
                You'll hear some of the brighter faces around here talk about honor and glory.
                I've got nothing against it, but for me, the promise of coin is what feeds my blade.
                Wherever someone in Skyrim doesn't feel up to defending their own honor, we'll take up their burden.

                Your question carries more weight than you may know, newcomer. The sort of thing some of us spend our lives pondering.
                The difference between a noble band of warriors and a ragged bunch of assassins is as thin as a blade's edge.
                I try to hold us to the right path.
            topic_info: 000DAB3B 
                Why would you even come to Jorrvaskr without knowing what we stand for?
                This is not play-acting, here. We are the true spirit of Skyrim. Honor is in our blood, death in our hearts.
                If you seek either, you've found the right place.

                I learned the ways of the blade in the Great War. Nearly lost my life outside the Imperial City. 
                I came home to Skyrim when it was all over. But I wasn't much good at anything other than fighting.
                Wandered around as a blade for hire. Was a damned good one, too.
                The money was good, and the women were good, and the drinks were good. But I was losing myself. My heart. 
                I was lucky the Companions found me. Now there's a reason to be fighting. The honor of my brothers and sisters is worth more than coin.
                Of course, the money is still good. And the drinks!

                My mother was a Companion. And her mother. And all the women in my family, back to Hrotti Blackblade. 
                I stayed with my father in the woods until I was old enough for my Trial. We hunted everything there was to hunt.
                Good training. 
                Ma didn't live long enough to see me join, but I fight to honor her and all my Shield-Sisters through time.

                Vilkas and I have been here since we were little whelps.
                Our father, Jergen, raised us here. 
                Even Vignar couldn't remember Companions younger than us!
            topic_info: 000DAB2E 
                To hear Farkas tell it, our father raised us here as happy pups, running around biting knees.
                I love my brother, but his brains are not his strong suit. 
                We were brought here by Jergen. Whether he was our father or not, I don't care.
                He left to fight in the Great War and never came back. So he's not my problem anymore.
                We've been here as long as either of us can remember, though. So try to show some respect.

                Like most of our band, I found this family after losing my own.
                I traveled the length and breadth of this land, learning all I could of the sword and the axe.
                I was just a boy, but I had the fire of a man in my heart. Eventually, my body caught up to my spirit.
                My predecessor, Askar, found me in Hammerfell. I was serving as bodyguard for some weak-necked lord out there.
                He brought me back here, and I realized... that I was actually coming home.
                I work to bring honor to this family, and to the family that I lost. For my mother, my father, and my grandfather. For all my Shield-Siblings.

                Skjor says it was more like forty, but he's just being modest.

                Fight with us and you'll have stories to tell. Come up to Jorrvaskr if you're worth anything in a fight.

                Here to be a Companion? Well, they just let me in, so there's probably no more room.
            topic_info: 00023E47 
                I was the newest Companion, until you came along. I guess that's ok. Just means I can show you the ropes!

                Oh, hey there. I killed a bear yesterday. Did you kill anything?

                Nirnroot is the easiest. It grows only by the water and makes a unique chiming noise. The only drawback is it won't regrow after harvesting.
                Nightshade is native to the pine forest and marshy tundra regions of Skyrim and has a distinctive starburst-like violet flower.
                Last we have deathbell which only grows in marshy tundra terrain. Its inverted bluish-purple flower bunches are unmistakable.

                That fetcher! I gave him the same keg just this morning and told him to store it in the cellars.
                Oh, he'll rot in prison for this one I promise you. As soon as Maven finds out, it's all over for him.
                Here, take this as a bit of a reward for nabbing our little thief.

                No, no friend. You've got it all wrong. I'm not selling cheap mead. I'm selling good mead for cheap... Black-Briar Mead.
                I sell cases of it for half of what the inns and taverns pay through the Meadery.
                All I need is someone to deliver it for me. If anyone saw me leave Riften, they'd get suspicious.

                Drop it off and he'll trade you something for the delivery. Keep it as payment for the legwork.
                Oh, and if you bump into Indaryn from the meadery, keep your mouth shut. He'd rat us out in a second.

                Sibbi and I were to be married. We were supposed to be happy together forever.
                Then I found that wretched poetry from Svana. When I confronted Sibbi about it, he threatened to kill me.
                I was scared so I told my brother Wulfur. He went to talk to Sibbi for me and... and... Sibbi killed him. My brother wasn't even armed!
                When I heard what Sibbi did, I fled. Now you've found me, and you're going to tell him where I am.

                In a mine, the poor man labors to find precious stones that only the rich man can afford.

                I wonder how many poor souls have lost their lives working these tunnels.

                I wonder what the ancient nords used this place for?
            topic_info: 00034717 
                The Dwemer who built this place were sometimes called Dwarves, but history records that they were no shorter than humans.
            topic_info: 00034719 
                There are scholars in Cyrodiil who have dedicated their lives to solving the mystery of the Dwemers' disappearance.

                It is remarkable that so many of these ancient Dwemer creations still function.
            topic_info: 00034721 
                There are those who believe that the entire Dwemer race will one day return just as suddenly as it vanished.

                The Dwemer created so many wondrous machines, and yet nobody ever followed in their footsteps. Why is that, I wonder?
            topic_info: 0003479F 
                Among other things, the Dwemer were expert trap-makers. Watch the floor for tripwires and false plates.

                I suppose the warmth in this place comes from all the hot steam vents.

                Mara is the Goddess of Love. The temple spreads her gifts by tending to the sick, the poor, and the lost.
                We also perform wedding ceremonies for all the loving couples in Skyrim.

                Typically, love in Skyrim is as earnest as the people who live here. Life is hard, and short, so there is little room for long courtship.
                A person who is looking for a spouse simply wears an Amulet of Mara about the neck, showing they are available.
                When another person shows interest, and the two agree to be together, one of them comes to the Temple and we arrange a ceremony.

                Now, let us put this behind us and speak of it no more.
            topic_info: 00073104 
                So we're not going to talk about this any more, right? Because I don't want to.
            topic_info: 00073105 
                This is last time we speak of this.
            topic_info: 00073106 
                Let's both get on with our lives now, hmm?
            topic_info: 00073107 
                Now, let's pretend this never happened, shall we?
            topic_info: 00073108 
                Umm... So, the business is done. This is the last we'll talk about it, right?
            topic_info: 00073109 
                The deed is done. We need speak of it no longer.
            topic_info: 0007310A 
                Now let us turn our conversation away from such unpleasantness.
            topic_info: 0007310B 
                Now let's, um, not talk about this anymore. Okay?
            topic_info: 0007310C 
                Now, let us bury the memory of these dark deeds.
            topic_info: 0007310D 
                Now, so we're clear - this is the last time we talk about this.
            topic_info: 0007310E 
                Now, as far as I'm concerned, none of this ever happened.
            topic_info: 0007310F 
                Now we can both pretend this whole thing never happened.
            topic_info: 00073110 
                I trust you'll keep your mouth shut about this.
            topic_info: 00073111 
                Now the whole thing's over and done with. So let's stop talking about it.
            topic_info: 00073113 
                Now... I trust we'll never have to speak of this again. To anyone.
            topic_info: 00073114 
                Now I just want to put the whole nasty business behind me.
            topic_info: 00073115 
                Now we can put this all behind us, hmm?
            topic_info: 00073116 
                Now we never talk about it again. Got it?
            topic_info: 00073117 
                Now let's not talk about it anymore, okay?
            topic_info: 00073118 
                Now... This conversation never happened. Understood?
            topic_info: 00073119 
                Anyway, it's done. Time to move on.
            topic_info: 0007311A 
                But enough of this. Such things are best forgotten.
            topic_info: 0007311B 
                Now let's just, you know, try to forget any of this ever happened. All right?
            topic_info: 0007311C 
                What happened is between you, me, and Azura. Let's keep it that way.
            topic_info: 0007311D 
                It's done. No more... no more talking about it.
            topic_info: 0007311E 
                Now, let us turn our thoughts to more pleasant matters.
            topic_info: 0007311F 
                Now, let's just pretend this never happened.
            topic_info: 00073120 
                I hope you'll agree that these dark deeds are best left forgotten...
            topic_info: 00073121 
                Now, let's pledge never to speak of this again.
            topic_info: 00073122 
                But let's not talk about it anymore. What's done is done.
            topic_info: 00073123 
                Now... I don't really want to talk about it anymore. So let's not.
            topic_info: 00073124 
                Now our business together is done.
            topic_info: 00073125 
                I trust we'll never need to speak of this again... to anyone.
            topic_info: 00073126 
                Let's go our separate ways now, hmm?
            topic_info: 00073127 
                I'm just glad to put all this behind me. So let's never speak of it again, okay?

                A family of thieves. Running their corrupt empire from Markarth.
                The Silver-Blood family own half the Reach, and they won't stop until they own all of it.

                Elisif mourns her husband deeply and she feels that a festival that burns a King in effigy is... distasteful.
                I've tried to convince her the festival is many centuries old and celebrates Solitude but I need proof.
                I believe King Olaf's verse will provide that proof.

                King Olaf was Olaf One-Eye? He famously captured the dragon Numinex and took him to Dragonsreach. What do we say really happened?

                Strange. According to history Solitude attacked Winterhold, but Aesgeir seems to be saying Olaf reacted. What do we say happened?

                When possible, we ask applicants to perform tasks the college needs completed. In this case, I do have a task befitting an aspiring bard...

                Elisif has forbidden the Burning of King Olaf, a Festival put on by the Bards College. We need to change her mind.
                To convince her I want to read King Olaf's Verse. A part of the Poetic Edda, the living history of Skyrim. Unfortunately the verse was lost long ago.

                Oh. Oh-no. This won't do at all. 
                The copy is incomplete, it's aged to the point that parts are unreadable.

                It means I can't read it to the court. Without the verse I won't be able to convince Elisif of the importance of The Burning of King Olaf Festival.
                If she isn't convinced of the festival's importance then she won't reverse her decision to stop the effigy burning.
                It means that the Burning of King Olaf, which the Bards College has held for time immemorial, won't be happening.

                He's sending you after King Olaf's Verse then? That's good, we shouldn't leave it lying around now that I've figured out where it is.
                The Verse was Svaknir's contribution to the Poetic Edda, the living history of Skyrim. Each bard adds to the Edda in his or her time.

                And a very ancient one.
                The verse criticized the reigning King Olaf. He was so incensed the bard was put to death and all the copies burned.
                At least, that's what we thought until I translated some ancient texts a year or so ago. We now believe King Olaf buried the truth with the bard.
                If I'm right Svaknir and King Olaf's Verse lie in Dead Men's Respite, along with the burial chamber of King Olaf himself.

                Comes down to trust, I expect. After Dengeir gave up his seat to his nephew, he didn't trust anyone.
                Everywhere he looks, he sees assassins, spies an' plots against him. I'm the only one he confides in.
                So, when he was made Jarl again, he didn't wait a moment to name me his Steward. He said I was the only choice.

                But what you must understand about Falkreath is that our town is defined, for better or wrose, by the large and ancient cemetery here.
                That's why the inn is called Dead Man's Drink, the farm is called Corpselight Farm, and so on. I suppose it's sort of a running joke.

                Many battles have been fought here over the centuries. Graves were dug and monuments built, and the town grew around these.
                In time, Falkreath came to be known as the heroes' graveyard. Many noble Jarls and renowned warriors asked to be buried here.
                Falkreath's reputation has faded somewhat, but the graves remain, reminding us of the one inevitable truth of life.

                When Dengeir's health began to fail, young Sidgeir was appointed Jarl in his stead. It was simpler just to keep me as steward.
                Sidgeir has no interest in running his hold, and so leaves such matters to me. As for my part, I do my best to see that folk are treated fairly.

                Truth is, I found out about all the Imperial spies crawling around Falkreath. A few well-placed bribes, and they bought themselves some friends. 
                Suddenly the nobles are calling for a new Jarl, and all the while their pockets are jingling with the sound of Imperial septims.

                You know, since Kodlak's funeral the Skyforge feels more... awake.
                It's always been said that the souls of the heroes of old are what give Skyforge steel its strength.
                But I think the forge knows the greatness of Kodlak's soul. I can't really explain, but it feels like it's... young.
                I'll wager it could now forge metal the likes of which hasn't been seen since eras long forgotten.
                I'm eager to try.

                I don't know if you're capable, and I don't have time to find out. If Kodlak will vouch for you, I might have some work you could do.

                He was always a quiet lad, but lately... something has changed. He's become brooding. Violent.
                He won't say a word to me, but I don't know how I upset him.

                It's kind of an amusing tale.
                I was making my way down the road from Ivarstead towards Riften, and I saw Vex fighting off a couple of wolves.

                Well, there were eight of them and she'd already killed three by the time I joined the fight.
                Together, we made short work of them and the last one limped away licking its wounds.

                Actually, that's when she politely asked me to hand over my coin purse. Can you imagine?
                We scuffled for a while, broke each other's weapons, and finally fell to the ground exhausted.

                Indeed.
                After a few minutes, she looked me dead in the eye and asked me if I wanted to join the Guild. Just like that, no apologies.

                I'll tell you, I wouldn't want to cross blades with Vex again, but I certainly wouldn't mind a bit of a scuffle...

                I used to live in Valenwood working at my father's winery... we made the finest wine to ever cross your lips I promise you.
                We were doing well, plenty of coin, a huge mansion and I was even betrothed to a lovely young woman.

                Because it was dull. Every day was the same boring routine; working at the winery, social visits with friends, parties with no one I cared about.
                I just wanted a little excitement. Something dangerous.

                I hooked up with a guild in Valenwood... I think they called themselves the Silver Crescents. Spent quite a few years doing jobs for them.
                Made a lot of coin, but I didn't care. I didn't really need it... I was running with them because it fit, made me feel alive.

                Well, after a while my father caught on to what I was doing. He confronted me one night and gave me a choice.
                Either leave Valenwood, or he'd have me thrown into jail. Gave me a day to say my goodbyes to everyone.

                He introduced me to Gallus, and that was it. I've been here ever since.
                And you know what? Despite what I left behind, I don't regret it one bit.

                I'll tell you about the time I was a young girl, barely out of her teens... living on a pig farm in the middle of nowhere.
                Didn't have a coin to spend between our entire family. Ate the same slop we fed our livestock.

                How about the fact that our farm was attacked by bandits, and that they killed my entire family who didn't even brandish a weapon against them.
                Here's the best part. They took me as a prize, and violated me for a fortnight. Tossed me from bandit to bandit like... like...

                Over time, I managed to gain their confidence. Then one night I grabbed a knife, waited until they fell asleep and cut their throats.
                I never returned to that pig farm you know. There's nothing for me there.
                So that's my sad story. What do you think?

                Perhaps. They could be nonsense... inane scribbles done by someone in idle boredom.
                But if not... if they actually mean something, they might tell me where I'm from... what ship was I on. Everything.

                I didn't mean to imply I was earning an honest living either.
                With my lock picking aptitude, I was a natural at jailbreaking... made a great deal of gold doing it too.

                It's where a client pays you to get arrested, and you get thrown into a prison for the express purpose of breaking out.
                Usually it's to free someone the client cares about... and sometimes to... well, to kill someone on their behalf.
                Either way, the trick was in the escape, and that's where my strengths came in handy.

                Well, as a jailbreaker, you work alone. No Guild to back you up.
                I'd do jobs for the Thieves Guild and the Dark Brotherhood, but if things didn't go as planned, I was on my own.

                The last jailbreak I attempted failed. I was imprisoned in High Rock for three years before they let me go.
                After that I promised myself I'd never do it again.

                I don't know. I think I realized that out in the world, my skills would bring me more wealth as a thief rather than an assassin.
                Killing someone in a jail is much easier than what the Dark Brotherhood deals with. I guess I wanted to play it safe.
                I already knew Delvin, I asked if I could join up, and that was that.

                I joined up with them maybe ten years ago.
                Small clan... maybe twenty men. We'd raid villages, rob caravans... but it was always about the killing for them.

                Don't get me wrong. The first few years with that clan were some of the best years of my life.
                All the food I could eat, all the wine I could drink and all the women I could bed.

                We raided a caravan one spring... I think it was a few wagons with some farmers moving to a new village.
                They didn't put up much of a fight. All that was left were the women and the children.
                Then the leader of our clan... Garthek... he ordered us to kill the rest.

                No, we usually let them go. I refused to do it, and Garthek ordered the clan to kill me as well.
                Luckily, I had made some friends with the clan who immediately sided with me.
                We tore each other to pieces. After it was over, those of us that remained simply went our separate ways.

                Well, you could always speak to Delvin or Vex if you're looking for extra work.
                Or if you're looking for training, we've got plenty of it down here. Delvin, Vex, Niruin and Vipir can give you a leg up on that.

                If you're lookin' to get some coin for the fruits of your labor, you should talk to Tonilia. She sounds tough, but she'll cut you a fair deal.

                If talking your way out of trouble isn't enough, you could always pick up some training from Delvin, Vex or Vipir.

                No. In fact, the Tong were quite the bitter rivals with the Dark Brotherhood.

                If the Dark Brotherhood discovered I had been a Morang Tong, they would come after me with a vengeance.
                Better to stay out of sight and ply my trade with the Thieves Guild than risk a contract on my head.

                I should hope so. The Dark Brotherhood is also known to place contracts on those who associate with the Morang Tong as well.
                So, unless you wish a visit from one of their own, I'd suggest you follow your own advice and keep your mouth shut.

                Well it was, up until the point where we set foot outside. The house was surrounded by town guard... the client had ratted us out.
                Vex just tells me to run, so I did. Half of them went after me, the other half went after her.

                Years ago, the Guild used to have a foothold in every major city in Skyrim. You wouldn't dare even lift an apple without checkin' with us.
                When things started goin' downhill around here, it became difficult to keep it all together. We lost fences, influential contacts and coin.
                It wasn't long before we lost what we depend on to survive... respect.
                By doin' these extra jobs and puttin' some fear into the people, we can take back the cities and start bein' taken seriously once again.

                The only way this place will ever return to its glory days is if we can finish these extra jobs and start the gold flowing again.

                Thanks to Maven Black-Briar, we still have some pull in Riften. But get arrested in Whiterun and you'll be tossed right into the prisons.
                If we can gain the confidence of someone very influential who lives there by doing a unique job for them, we'd be able to have some leverage there too.
                The only way to get that special job is by doin' smaller ones in those cities until we catch their ear... then they'll contact me and we're off.

                The Flagon was once a city beneath a city. We had our own smith, our own alchemist... you name it.
                If we can make a name for ourselves in Skyrim once again, I can almost promise you those merchants would return.
                Best of all, we'd have enough gold to throw around so we can start living in the lap of luxury again.

            topic_info: 000E5759 
                Get the job done and get back alive. That's all there is to it.

            topic_info: 000E5763 
                Walking away without taking a job is like passing a bloated coinpurse on a table.

                My specialty is pickpocketing. All I need is a rich mark, a moon-lit sky and I'm in my element.

                Want to talk? Go ahead.
            topic_info: 000E50BD 
                They call me Sapphire because I love to steal them.
            topic_info: 000E50BE 
                Don't get me wrong, I'll steal any gem that isn't nailed down. But there's something about those blue stones that gets my blood boiling.
            topic_info: 000E50C1 
                When people ask my real name, know what I tell them? Don't ask.

                Sure I might have some dirt in my past, but that's just ancient history.

                Last time someone cheated me, I cut off their hand. Still have it actually.
            topic_info: 000E50C5 
                Wanted to say something to you.
            topic_info: 000E50C6 
                I think you're all right. In fact, I'm kind of impressed how well you're doing around here. Just keep it between us, okay?
            topic_info: 000E50C7

                I don't care if Vex was chosen as a Guild Third over me, she deserved it.
            topic_info: 000E50D3 
                I kind of like watching things from where I am. Making money is all I care about.

            topic_info: 000E50D6 
                You're pretty tough, I respect that. Bringing in a lot of coin for the Guild, making us look good too. Let me know if you need anything, okay?
            topic_info: 000E50D7 
                Need something?
            topic_info: 000E50D8 
                You want to talk to me? Okay.
            topic_info: 000E50D9 
                Yeah, I guess I have a minute. What do you want?
            topic_info: 000E50DA 
                I'm the heavy hitter around here. When someone needs pushing around, I'm the one they send in.

                The Daedric Lord Vaermina's voracious hunger for memories is responsible for these visions.

                Not long, in truth. I came to Skyrim after I found myself unwelcome in both Elsweyr and Cyrodiil.
                I seem to have an unfortunate talent for getting myself involved in misunderstandings with the law.
                Ri'saad was able to look past that, and it was he who helped to set me up with a trade caravan. Now I work for him.

                He hired the others and paid for my goods. I am allowed to run the caravan, but I pay Ri'saad a percentage of my profits.
                I say this without bitterness, for it was Ri'saad who saved me from a life of servitude aboard a trading ship.
                I am grateful to have the life that I do now. It is a far cry from my days as an orphan on the streets of Corinthe.

                An astute question, for we are far from home and this is a cold, hard land.
                The wise trader finds the best opportunities, even if he must travel far to find them. Skyrim is a ripe opportunity indeed.
                The dragons and the war have scared many other traders away, but for those with courage, there is much profit to be made.

                It is Ri'saad who owns the three trading caravans that travel the roads of Skyrim.
                Long ago, I was an orphan on the streets of Corinthe. I stowed away aboard a trade ship that brought me here. It was Ri'saad who found me.
                He provided the funds to start this caravan, and put me in charge of it. I owe him more than I could ever hope to repay.

                The Khajiit hail from a distant land called Elsweyr, bordered on the north by Cyrodiil and the south by the glistening blue waters of the sea.
                Elsweyr is an arid land of deserts and rocky canyons, where the sun shines warmly, always.
                There are cities so ancient, the sands have swallowed them whole. But now I will say no more, for I miss my home greatly.

                Yes, I was hired to protect the others as we walk the roads of Skyrim.
                It is a thankless task and I would rather be back home in Elsweyr, but I have little choice.
                Ahkari freed me from a prison in Cyrodiil, and now I must repay my debt to him.
                A word of advice, my friend --  do not mix gambling and drink. Taken together, they will empty your pockets of every septim.

                Quite the opposite, in fact.
                The soldiers are some of our best customers, for we offer supplies and wares they cannot obtain by other means.
                It was Ri'saad's idea to come here now, while the land is in turmoil. Where others saw only danger, he saw opportunity.

                Mostly it is the Nords. They do not like outsiders in their land, and so we are forbidden to enter the cities.
                When they look upon us, they see only pickpockets and skooma dealers. It is most unfair, but we do our best to ignore them.

                Aye, that I did. I commanded a force of several dozen men, most of them levies from villages in this part of the hold.
                I damn near met my end in that war. An Aldmeri soldier ran me through with his blade and left me for dead.

                Have you met Rorik? He owns these lands, and it's from him that our village gets its name. We have been friends for many years now.
                Rorik fought for the Empire in the Great War. He was gravely wounded, and so was brought before me. I was a healer then, you see.
                We were as close as kinsmen, and when Rorik returned home I came with him. I am happy to spend my twilight years here with my good friend.

                Yes, that's right.  Look around you. Most of the lands you see are mine.
                Most of this I purchased while my comrades were fighting in the south, helping the Empire against the Aldmeri Dominion.
                Back then, nothing would grow here and so the land was worthless. Now, thanks to hard work and the gods' blessings, our farms prosper.

                Not yet, anyway, though it certainly could.
                With most of the hold's fighting men committed to the war, there are fewer swords to keep the roads safe from brigands and wild beasts.
                And of course, as the war drags on and supplies run low, our ample fields and stores of food will make a tempting target for desperate men.
                The best we can hope for a swift end to the conflict. The longer the war goes on, the worse it will be for all for us, I'm afraid.

                We'll keep peace and order in Dawnstar.

                As for work, you could try to catch Skald in a good mood, but your best bet would be working in the mines. They're on opposite ends of town.

                The only reason dragons are attacking is because Talos is angry with us for turning our backs on him.
                As soon as we drive the Empire out of Skyrim, the dragons will vanish. Mark my words.

                About 30 years ago, the Aldmeri Dominion invaded the Empire. It was a surprise attack, caught everyone off guard.
                They ended up sacking the Imperial City. I was there, blasting apart young Elven men and women with Fireballs and Lightning Bolts.
                By Akatosh, all the blood. The smell of flesh burned and pulled apart by magic. I never want to do that to another soul ever again.

                The Stormcloaks are destined to win this fight. Talos is with us, and when you fight under a Divine's blessing, victory is assured.

                Second, we have the "White-Gold Tower" which is heavy cream with a layer of blended mead, lavender and dragon's tongue on top.

                Lilija joined the Stormcloaks many years ago, when the first of the skirmishes broke out across Skyrim. I was so proud of her.
                She served as a Battle Maiden, using her healing arts to help those that fell on the battlefield. Never even lifted a blade in her life.
                It didn't matter. The Imperial soldiers cut her down... killed her like a dog and left her body to rot in the mud.
                And that's why I won't rest easy until every single Imperial soldier joins her, and Ulfric sits upon the throne of Skyrim.

                Someone actually interested in what I'm doing? Amazing! Well, allow me to explain.
                My experimentation involves a magical construct and a reagent that will allow the construct to maintain a field of permanent harmonic energy!

                You don't have to, because it's utter nonsense. It's never going to work.
                No, no, no. What I need to do is to reverse that. Draw the harmonic energy into the reagent and then apply it with the proper incantation.
                What was I thinking? It would never work that first way. Why didn't you tell me?

                I'll tell you why you won't tell me. Because you were absolutely right not to.
                It's a fundamental rule of magic and it would be ridiculous. You can't draw from harmonic energy without a soul siphon.
                Since you're so well informed I'm certain you've solved the problem with thermic drift, right?

                Before he left, he said he was going to do the Black Sacrament. You know, to call the Dark Brotherhood. So they'd come and kill old Grelod!
                Word out on the street is that he went home to Windhelm, and people have heard strange chanting coming from his house. He's really doing it!

                Ulfric's a bloody hero. I don't think there's a worthy Nord alive who'd dare argue the point.
                He's taking the Empire to task and making them answer for their crimes.
                I don't think I'll be content until Ulfric sits upon the throne of Skyrim with the ashes of the Concordat at his feet.

                Surely you're aware of the Great War between the Imperials and the Elves who called themselves the Aldmeri Dominion?
                When the smoke cleared, the White-Gold Concordat was signed... it was supposedly a treaty aimed at establishing peace within the Empire.
                One of the terms of the treaty was the outlawing of worship to Talos.
                To the Stormcloaks, this was viewed as the moment when the Empire became unworthy of the allegiance of any true Nord.

                Yes, actually. I'm partnered with Maven Black-Briar. I put up a chunk of the gold she needed to get the place off the ground.
                We've been staggeringly successful so far. In fact, I'm almost surprised how quickly she's generated business for us.

                Please to meet you, I'm a priestess at the Temple of Mara.
            topic_info: 00042342 
                Thanks again for the delivery to Markarth. What can I do for you?
            topic_info: 000557AA 
                Did you get that purchase agreement to Markarth yet?
            topic_info: 00042341 
                New in town, eh? Here for the fishing I'd guess.
            topic_info: 000557AC 
                There's nothing like fishing on Lake Honrich, you should try it sometime.
            topic_info: 00036C45 
                If you're hungry, Marise sells fresh fish... caught by yours truly.
            topic_info: 00042348 
                If you're looking for a handout, you're not going to get one from me.
            topic_info: 000D82C9 
                Can you believe my former husband used to give most of our gold to the poor?
            topic_info: 000D82CA 
                If you're looking for a handout, you'll want to speak with my husband.
            topic_info: 00042349 
                If you're looking for a handout, you'll want to speak with my husband. If you're looking for company, I suppose I could do worse.
            topic_info: 0004234A 
                Bolli's around somewhere, planning to feed the poor with his nonsense about Mara.
            topic_info: 0004234B 
                With my husband's new found religion, what I do with our coin and what I do all day seem less important to him. Suits me.
            topic_info: 0004234C 
                At this rate, he'll give the entire Riften Fishery away to charity. Then how will I live?
            topic_info: 0004234D 
                Such a waste of time preaching to the poor. If they're that hungry, they should just grow some food or something.
            topic_info: 0004234E 
                I spend every Friday at the fishery, so I know the meaning of hard work. All those forms to fill out and file; it's exhausting!
            topic_info: 0004234F 
                Mark my words. If Bolli thinks he's giving all of our wealth away to some poor slob, I'll leave him high and dry.
            topic_info: 00042350 
                I'm feeling much better thanks to your efforts.
            topic_info: 00043DF8 
                The pilgrimage is complete, I can feel it.
            topic_info: 00043DF9 
                Anything else before you make the journey?
            topic_info: 00043DFA 
                Come to laugh at the grave tender?
            topic_info: 00042351 
                I can see that disapproving look in your eye.
            topic_info: 00053301 
                Oh, it's you. Come to extort more from me?
            topic_info: 00041F85 
                New around Riften? Take my advice. Stay at the Bee and Barb... the Bunkhouse isn't for you.
            topic_info: 00042356 
                If you're looking for a bed, this is the wrong place.
            topic_info: 00042357 
                You looking for something or what?
            topic_info: 0004235D 
                Hey! Good to see you again.
            topic_info: 00041F86 
                Any luck getting the marks from those men?
            topic_info: 00041F88 
                Sorry about the mess. Keeping this place clean is quite a chore.
            topic_info: 0004235E 
                I'd appreciate it if you'd keep your hands to yourself.
            topic_info: 0004235F 
                The Bunkhouse isn't an inn. I'd recommend the Bee and Barb.
            topic_info: 00042362 
                Who did this to me?
            topic_info: 0006DA82 
                This city is corrupt! You're all corrupt!
            topic_info: 0006DA83 
                This is unfair! I'm innocent!
            topic_info: 0006DA84 
                Can I interest you in some fine goods from Morrowind?
            topic_info: 00042364 
                Have anything you wish to sell? I pay fair prices for all sorts of goods.
            topic_info: 00042363 
                If there's anything you wish to purchase, just let me know.
            topic_info: 00083867 
                If you're ever in the market, I deal in specialty goods from Morrowind at one of the stands.
            topic_info: 00042369 
                Working at the Riften Fishery is tough, but it puts some coin in my pocket.
            topic_info: 00042367 
                I'm beginning to think leaving Mournhold was a mistake.
            topic_info: 00042368 
                If Riften is the best Skyrim has to offer, I may as well turn back right now and just head for home.
            topic_info: 00042374 
                Welcome to Riften, traveler. I hope the road fared well for you.
            topic_info: 00042375 
                What can I do for you?
            topic_info: 000BD77B 
                Speak, I wish to hear everything my subjects have to say.
            topic_info: 00042376 
                I feel so helpless out here. The people of Riften depended on me, and I failed them.
            topic_info: 000BD77C 
                Unmid and Anuriel shouldn't blame themselves for Riften's fall, I am the one who's ultimately responsible.
            topic_info: 000BD77D 
                If Riften can be retaken, I will redouble my efforts to ensure the safety of my subjects and the defense of the Rift.
            topic_info: 0004237B 
                Out of my way. The son of the Jarl has no time for idle conversation with travelers.
            topic_info: 0004237D 
                If this isn't about official city business, you're wasting my time.
            topic_info: 000BD781 
                I presume you have something important to say?
            topic_info: 00042381 
                Come to gloat, have we? To poke fun at the jarl's youngest son?
            topic_info: 00042382 
                I can feel you laughing behind my back.
            topic_info: 00042383 
                Did Harrald send you to taunt me?
            topic_info: 00042389 
                Welcome to Mistveil Keep. I'm Jarl Laila's steward, Anuriel.
            topic_info: 00042388 
                As Riften's Steward I'm afraid I can provide only limited assistance, but speak your mind.
            topic_info: 000BD782 
                If you're here to report any instances of corruption, be confident that we're handling these rumors accordingly.
            topic_info: 00042387 
                I'm afraid my days as the steward of Riften has come to an end.
            topic_info: 000BD783 
                The Imperials now control Riften and have placed Maven Black-Briar on the Jarl's throne.
            topic_info: 000BD784 
                Perhaps the Stormcloaks might rally to take back Riften one day. Only time will tell.
            topic_info: 0004238D 
                As Jarl Laila's housecarl, I would ask that you maintain a respectable distance from her at all times.
            topic_info: 0004238E 
                Did you have some sort of official business here?
            topic_info: 0004238F 
                I'd request that when speaking to Jarl Laila, you show the proper respect.
            topic_info: 00042390 
                Being in exile is the most humiliating thing I've experienced in my life.
            topic_info: 00042391 
                I killed scores of the Empire's men before I was forced to surrender.
            topic_info: 00042392 
                The only reason I stopped fighting was a plea from Laila, otherwise I'd would have fought to the death.
            topic_info: 00042394 
                I know you. Where was it? Hm. Oh! You were getting something for me?
            topic_info: 00043E01 
                Did we have an appointment? No... it was a delivery? I can't remember.
            topic_info: 00042395 
                Excuse my disorganization, but I'm in the middle of some delicate experiments.
            topic_info: 00053303 
                Come to see Balimund perform miracles with steel, eh?
            topic_info: 00013631 
                What brings you to Balimund today? Repair? Purchase?
            topic_info: 00042399 
                Nothing like the smell of a white-hot blade, eh?
            topic_info: 0004239A 
                Looking for some armor? A weapon perhaps?
            topic_info: 0004239F 
                Here to purchase some armor or a weapon?
            topic_info: 00021CF8 
                How can I help you today?
            topic_info: 00021CFA 
                Have you met Balimund? I'm his apprentice. He's teaching me all about being a blacksmith.
            topic_info: 000423A0 
                I used to live at the orphanage here in Riften. Grelod said my ma and da left me there when I was a baby... that they didn't want me.
            topic_info: 000423A1 
                Balimund took me in and has been so kind to me. I don't know why, but he thinks I can be a great blacksmith like him.
            topic_info: 000423A2 
                At first I don't know why he picked me. I never even held a hammer in my life! But the first time I picked it up, it just felt right!
            topic_info: 000423A3 
                Folks in town say that Balimund is the greatest blacksmith in all of Tamriel. I hope I can live up to that some day and make him proud of me.
            topic_info: 000423A4 
                Welcome back! Good to see you again.
            topic_info: 00083AA2 
                Ah, you're back. What have you discovered?
            topic_info: 00053304 
                Oh, it's you. Not here to rob me are you?
            topic_info: 00083AA3 
                Well met, friend. How can I help you?
            topic_info: 00083AA4 
                You're a stranger here too, eh?
            topic_info: 000423A7 
                Visitors like us are rare in this part of Skyrim.
            topic_info: 000423AA 
                I've never seen Mjoll this upset about anything. The city really gets to her.
            topic_info: 000423AB 
                Mjoll told me that it isn't this bad everywhere. Maybe one day I'll venture out and see if she's right.
            topic_info: 000423AC 
                Mjoll's brought me nothing but safety and piece of mind... and some lessons with the blade.
            topic_info: 000423AD 
                I hope that someday this city will be free from corruption and we can all live in peace.
            topic_info: 000423AF 
                You here for lessons like Ingun? Or did you wish to buy something?
            topic_info: 000423AE 
                Do you have any idea how busy I am? My mixture could be burning as we speak!
            topic_info: 000423B0 
                Take a look at my supplies if you must, but do hurry... I'm not getting any younger you know!
            topic_info: 000423B4

                Where's my head? I never even greeted you properly.
            topic_info: 000423B6 
                I apologize in advance for my husband's crankiness; I promise you he means well.
            topic_info: 000423B9 
                Please, please. I need but a septim. A septim is all I ask. Is that so bad?
            topic_info: 000423BA 
                I can't take this place anymore. The trees... all the colors, but the city, so dark. Why? It makes no sense.
            topic_info: 000423BB 
                So cold, so hungry, so tired.
            topic_info: 000423BC 
                No one cares about us! No one! We could die and no one would ever even know! They'd just throw our corpses in the canal!
            topic_info: 000423BD 
                Are you scared of death? I am. I hear everything just stops... forever. It just all goes away, but you don't realize it. I don't want to die.
            topic_info: 000423BE 
                Sure, sure. I'm a dirty beggar... why would you want to even speak to me.
            topic_info: 000423BF 
                To Oblivion with all of you! You rich piles of dung walking by us like we're not there! Pretending we don't exist! How dare you!
            topic_info: 000423C0 
                You think you know pain? Do you!? Try watching your wife and daughter burn alive after they've been ravaged by brigands! That's pain, my friend.
            topic_info: 000423C1 
                Edda... she's crazy as a loon, but at least she doesn't have the mind to realize what a horrible world this is. She's the lucky one.
            topic_info: 000423C2 
                Just leave Riften. Go far, far away and never return. This place is nothing but a rotten, stinking corpse that's sat in the sun far too long.
            topic_info: 000423C3 
                Greetings, honored friend. Could I interest you in some fine jewelry?
            topic_info: 000423C4 
                If anything pleases the eye, don't hesitate to make me an offer.
            topic_info: 000423C5 
                If you have any jewelry to sell, I'd be glad to pay you a fair sum in gold for it.
            topic_info: 00083868 
                Come see me in the market if you're looking for the finest custom jewelry in all of Skyrim.

                So, you're Brynjolf's new protege, eh? Don't look like much to me.

                It's one thing to say you've got the skills to be a thief. It's another to actually use them.
            topic_info: 00044BDB 
                It's been a long time since anyone joined us. Seems like people are in a rush to leave.

                Something has to change soon or I may as well pack this place up and leave it for the skeevers.
            topic_info: 00044BDF 
                You better have coin to pay for your drinks. There's no handouts here.
            topic_info: 00044BE0 
                Got a lot of nerve coming down here. People tend to get hurt in the Ratway.
            topic_info: 00044BE1 
                I wouldn't stay here long if I were you.
            topic_info: 00044BE2 
                There's a reason the city guard doesn't come down here you know.
            topic_info: 00044BE3 
                Don't make trouble or else I'll ask Dirge to "walk" you out.
            topic_info: 00044BE4 
                Even if you're one of us, you better not make trouble.

                I don't care if you're best buddies with the Guild Master. I'll still smash in your skull if you try anything.

                The last person that made trouble for Vekel ended up floating in the canal... catch my drift?

                Last person who made trouble for Vekel ended up with a smashed head.

                Vekel doesn't like strangers snooping around the Flagon.
            topic_info: 00044BEB 
                There's two things to do at the Flagon: spend coin and then get out.

                That's the only time when we get food, too. And if there's not enough ore mined up, we don't get any.

            topic_info: 0006DE3E 
                The key to wards is that they take time to charge.
                Not long, but you can't start casting with a fireball coming at you.
                Also, if your ward isn't negated by an incoming spell, it will recharge itself after a moment or two.
                Just be careful. Casting wards requires constant concentration, and you can easily find yourself drained of your magicka reserves.

                Magic is shunned by most. If it can't be swung over your head and used to crack skulls, most Nords want nothing to do with it.

                Oh my, that's quite a difficult question.
                Never underestimate the ability to influence others. Whether they're friends or foes, they're almost all susceptible to Illusion spells.
                They can turn the tide of a battle in a moment's notice.
                There are also spells that help in avoiding conflict altogether. Invisibility is tricky to master, but exceptionally useful.

                I am Savos Aren, Arch-Mage of the College of Winterhold.
                I am quite content to see nearly any aspect of magic explored and investigated here.
                But I do not and will not approve of any research or experiments that cause purposeful harm to your fellow members of the College.
                Are we clear?

                If you require assistance with summoning techniques, please let me know.
                If you would, please also contain your summons to the College grounds. The locals do not need to be agitated further by Atronachs roaming their town.
                The summoning of undead is even less advisable outside of the College.

                Well, I suppose he wouldn't mind...
                It was all before my time, you understand. I've heard the stories, the same as anyone else.
                He was a brilliant student, an accomplished wizard. Delved into magic in a way none had seen before.
                But, I think, he became too focused on just how much power he could acquire. That's what led to the accident.
            topic_info: 001035B9 
                Do you remember what I first told you, about how not being able to control magic could destroy you?
                I didn't simply mean it could kill you. The Augur's accident is another very real type of a life destroyed.
                Well, it's been described as an accident. I can't imagine it was intentional.
                Something must've gone wrong, and he ended up in the state he's in now, fused to the energies that flow through the College.
                I've never felt it appropriate to ask him about it, about how that must feel. Or, I suppose, if he can feel at all.

                Well, look at the evidence. Nords generally don't trust magic, so it's not off to a good start.
                Throw in the Oblivion Crisis, which was caused by magic-users, and the troubles now with the Aldmeri Dominion, who are elves and magic users.
                And finally take the fact that the College is the only thing left standing after most of Winterhold was destroyed. It's all fairly damning.

                Falion said he hated what this place was becoming. So he just left. Aren found a note on his desk, and that was it.

                Necromancy, as any other type of magic, is a tool to be used.

                Certainly. Destruction spells come in different forms, each useful for various purposes.
                Concentration spells can be cast immediately, though they're weaker. Good for a tight spot, and less costly if you miss.
                You'll also need to decide whether to devote yourself to a single type of spell.
                Focusing solely on flame spells will make them more powerful, but you may find yourself at a disadvantage against foes immune to fire.

                Oh, but you are wrong.
                The only reason you could disagree is because you are losing so badly you cannot see it.

                Didn't you know?
                Before the Oblivion Crisis, many elves called Winterhold their home. More visited the College from Morrowind every year.
                After, growing distrust of magic made life difficult for many. Some left rather than endure the growing hatred from the local Nords.
                Others returned home after the Red Year, when Vvardenfell erupted and caused much destruction.
                Winterhold itself died in the years between then and now. What's left out there is a husk. Only the College really remains.

                I'm not certain what use it would be.
                The Staff is said to be able to absorb great amounts of energy. Perhaps it can interact with the Eye in a way that nothing else can.
            topic_info: 000E353B 
                I don't know, not for sure.
                But perhaps the staff can absorb some of the energy coming out of the Eye, weaken it. Allow us to get close to Ancano.

                It should be embarrassed to be uncovered so.
            topic_info: 000A8613 
                Umm. You got no clothes. You should get some.
            topic_info: 000A8614 
                Naked. Naked, naked, naked!
            topic_info: 000A8615 
                Dress yourself.
            topic_info: 000A8616 
                Ought put on some clothes. Bound to upset some people...
            topic_info: 000A8617 
                Put on a cloth sack at the very least. You're making me... unseasonably warm...
            topic_info: 000A8618 
                Aren't you... embarrassed?
            topic_info: 000A8619 
                You aren't as attractive as you'd like to believe.
            topic_info: 000A861A 
                Either I'm drunk, or you're naked. Possibly both.
            topic_info: 000A861B 
                Cover yourself. Have you no shame?
            topic_info: 000A861C 
                Next time, you might want to get dressed before leaving the house.
            topic_info: 000A861D 
                This one suggests donning some apparel.
            topic_info: 000A861E 
                Ysmir's beard, you're going to freeze to death...
            topic_info: 000A861F 
                Put on some damn clothes already!
            topic_info: 000A8620 
                You really should put on some clothes, you know.
            topic_info: 000A8621 
                All right, we've all seen enough. Put on some clothes.
            topic_info: 000A8622 
                The way you walk around at home is your own business. When you're at home...
            topic_info: 000A8623 
                What are you, some kind of barbarian? Don't care for armor?
            topic_info: 000A8624 
                It's probably not a good idea to walk around naked like that.

            topic_info: 0006FEBF 
                What do you think you're doing? Knock it off with the flames already.
            topic_info: 0006FEC1 
                Is it getting hot, or is it just me?
            topic_info: 0006FEC2 
                Whoa. Hope you know what you're doing with those flames there.

            topic_info: 0006FEC9 
                Umm... don't suppose you'd want to take that fire somewhere else? You know... somewhere away from me?

            topic_info: 000730BD 
                Now, let's pretend this never happened, shall we?
            topic_info: 000730BE 
                Umm... So, the business is done. This is the last we'll talk about it, right?
            topic_info: 000730BF 
                The deed is done. We need speak of it no longer.
            topic_info: 000730C0 
                Now let us turn our conversation away from such unpleasantness.
            topic_info: 000730C1 
                Now let's, um, not talk about this anymore. Okay?
            topic_info: 000730C2 
                Now, let us bury the memory of these dark deeds.
            topic_info: 000730C3 
                Now, so we're clear - this is the last time we talk about this.
            topic_info: 000730C4 
                Now, as far as I'm concerned, none of this ever happened.
            topic_info: 000730C5 
                Now we can both pretend this whole thing never happened.
            topic_info: 000730C6 
                I trust you'll keep your mouth shut about this.
            topic_info: 000730C7 
                Now the whole thing's over and done with. So let's stop talking about it.
            topic_info: 000730C9 
                Now... I trust we'll never have to speak of this again. To anyone.
            topic_info: 000730CA 
                Now I just want to put the whole nasty business behind me.
            topic_info: 000730CB 
                Now we can put this all behind us, hmm?
            topic_info: 000730CC 
                Now we never talk about it again. Got it?
            topic_info: 000730CD 
                Now let's not talk about it anymore, okay?
            topic_info: 000730CE 
                Now... This conversation never happened. Understood?
            topic_info: 000730CF 
                Anyway, it's done. Time to move on.
            topic_info: 000730D0 
                But enough of this. Such things are best forgotten.
            topic_info: 000730D1 
                Now let's just, you know, try to forget any of this ever happened. All right?
            topic_info: 000730D2 
                What happened is between you, me, and Azura. Let's keep it that way.
            topic_info: 000730D3 
                It's done. No more... no more talking about it.
            topic_info: 000730D4 
                Now, let us turn our thoughts to more pleasant matters.
            topic_info: 000730D5 
                Now, let's just pretend this never happened.
            topic_info: 000730D6 
                I hope you'll agree that these dark deeds are best left forgotten...
            topic_info: 000730D7 
                Now, let's pledge never to speak of this again.
            topic_info: 000730D8 
                But let's not talk about it anymore. What's done is done.
            topic_info: 000730D9 
                Now... I don't really want to talk about it anymore. So let's not.
            topic_info: 000730DA 
                Now our business together is done.
            topic_info: 000730DB 
                I trust we'll never need to speak of this again... to anyone.
            topic_info: 000730DC 
                Let's go our separate ways now, hmm?
            topic_info: 000730DD 
                I'm just glad to put all this behind me. So let's never speak of it again, okay?
            topic_info: 000730DE 
                It speaks truthfully.
            topic_info: 000730DF 
                Um... yeah...

                You're correct.
            topic_info: 00073102 
                Yes.
            topic_info: 000A8625 
                It should put on some coverings.
            topic_info: 000A8626 
                You're naked!
            topic_info: 000A8627 
                Put on some clothes, you damned fool.
            topic_info: 000A8628 
                You ought to cover your... unmentionables.
            topic_info: 000A8629 
                Even rags would be preferable to your current wardrobe. Or lack thereof...
            topic_info: 000A862A 
                Careful. They might put you away if you don't at least put on some pants.
            topic_info: 000A862B 
                I've seen enough. Put on some clothes.
            topic_info: 000ADC65 
                What the..?
            topic_info: 000ADC66 
                What are you doing?
            topic_info: 000AB3D3 
                What is the meaning of this?
            topic_info: 000AB3D4 
                What's going on?
            topic_info: 000AB3D5 
                What in the name of the gods are you doing?
            topic_info: 000AB3D6 
                Careful!
            topic_info: 000AB3D7 
                Wait, what are you doing?
            topic_info: 000AB3D8 
                Fool! What do you think you're doing?
            topic_info: 000AB3D9 
                Look... You shouldn't be doing that...
            topic_info: 000AB3DA 
                This is going to end horribly, I just know it.
            topic_info: 000AB3DB 
                Gods help us, this can't end well.
            topic_info: 000AB3DC 
                Magic. Foul magic...
            topic_info: 000AB3DD 
                Oh, someone's going to get hurt, I just know it...
            topic_info: 000AB3DE 
                Damned wizards and their damned magic...
            topic_info: 000AB3DF 
                Oh goodness, someone's going to get killed.
            topic_info: 000AB3E1 
                Whoa, now... ease off on the magic...
            topic_info: 000AB3E2 
                Oh, now, that can't be good...
            topic_info: 000AB3E3 
                Someone stop this fool sorcerer before someone gets killed.
            topic_info: 000AB3E4 
                Ysmir's beard - I don't like the look of this...
            topic_info: 000AB3E5 
                You shouldn't play around with magic like that...
            topic_info: 000AB3E6 
                Mind your tricks, wizard. No need for someone to get hurt...
            topic_info: 000AB3E7 
                I don't know if that's such a good idea...
            topic_info: 000AB3E8 
                Oh, I do not approve at all.
            topic_info: 000AB3E9 
                Oh, no... No, no, no...
            topic_info: 000AB3EA 
                Crazy n'wah - you're trying to get someone killed?
            topic_info: 000AB3EB 
                Oh, great. I'm gonna get killed by a crazy wizard...
            topic_info: 000AB3EC 
                The world's gone mad with sorcerers now, is that it?
            topic_info: 000AB3ED 
                Ah, dangerous...
            topic_info: 000AB3EE 
                I think it's time to leave...
            topic_info: 000AB3EF 
                By Ysmir, this will not end well...
            topic_info: 000AB3F0 
                You're going to get us all killed, you damn fool!
            topic_info: 000AB3F1 
                Oh, now, do be careful...
            topic_info: 000AB3F2 
                Magic. Great.
            topic_info: 000AB3F3 
                Oh, this is not going to end well...
            topic_info: 000AB3F4 
                You there! What are you doing?
            topic_info: 000AB3F5 
                This doesn't look good.
            topic_info: 000ADC67 
                Not now.
            topic_info: 000ADC68 
                I don't want to talk about it.
            topic_info: 000ADC69 
                Not now.

            topic_info: 000ADC6B 
                Begone. I have no wish to speak to anyone right now.

            topic_info: 000ADC6D 
                Not now.
            topic_info: 000ADC6E 
                Have the decency to leave me to my sorrows.
            topic_info: 000ADC6F 
                Not now, please.
            topic_info: 000ADC70 
                Not now.
            topic_info: 000ADC71 
                Get out of here.... I'm in no mood to talk...
            topic_info: 000ADC72 
                Leave me alone. Can't you see I'm upset?
            topic_info: 000ADC73 
                Not now. I'm... much too upset to talk.
            topic_info: 000ADC74 
                Go on, leave me alone...
            topic_info: 000ADC75

                Please, I can't... Just... just go.
            topic_info: 000ADC79 
                Go away.
            topic_info: 000ADC7A

                I can't talk now.
            topic_info: 000ADC7E 
                Now is not a good time. Leave me alone.
            topic_info: 000ADC7F 
                Go away... please?
            topic_info: 000ADC80 
                Now is not the time for talk...
            topic_info: 000ADC81 
                I want a drink, not company. Now go.
            topic_info: 000ADC82 
                I'm in no mood for conversation. Now go, and leave me be.
            topic_info: 000ADC83 
                Not now, please. I'm just... too upset to talk.
            topic_info: 000ADC84 
                Go away.
            topic_info: 000ADC85 
                Let me stew. Alone.
            topic_info: 000ADC86 
                Just... get out of my face. I've got nothing to say.
            topic_info: 000ADC87 
                Please... I... I can't talk to you right now...
            topic_info: 000ADC88 
                Go away. Now.
            topic_info: 000ADC89

                Look... Now's not a good time...
            topic_info: 000DEE8F 
                How are we doing over here?
            topic_info: 000DEE90 
                You want another one of those?
            topic_info: 000DEE91 
                There's plenty more where that came from. Just give a holler.
            topic_info: 000B80A3

                Now at last, the Thalmor will get their way. The worship of Talos will finally be stamped out. Or so they think.
                Those true sons and daughters of Skyrim will never cease to worship mighty Talos. If we cannot do so in our temples, we will do so in our hearts.
                Oblivion take the Thalmor! I'll never give up Talos, not even if it means my life. Let them come and make me a martyr!

                He's tough, loyal to his men and a good leader, but if you're not a Nord, Ulfric will never trust you.

                Windhelm is divided into four quarters. The Gray Quarter is the one that's home to all the city's Dark Elves.
                If it looks to you like an impoverished slum, that's because it is. Ulfric prefers that we live in squalor.
                He has nothing but disdain for anyone who isn't a Nord. He tolerates us, but that's the extent of his hospitality.

                Ulfric fought for that dream with more courage and honor than any Nord who ever lived. But now he's gone, and the dream is gone with him.
                But I'll be ready when a new leader takes up the cause. As sure as ice is cold and stone is hard, I'll be ready.

                Windhelm is one of the oldest human cities in all of Tamriel. In fact, it was the capital of the First Empire, which was founded by Ysgramor
                The Palace of the Kings in which you now stand is one of the last buildings that remain from that era.
                Long ago, the Empire used the city to garrison troops who guarded the passes to Morrowind.
                And now, thanks to you, the city is back under the Empire's banner.

                Still, having a just and honorable man like Brunwulf in charge can only be an improvement.
                Unlike Ulfric, Brunwulf has shown a great willingness to work with the other races and make us feel more at home here.

                Well, a few reasons come to mind.
                In my days as a riverboat captain, I was known to run a tight ship.
                That, and I made my fortune by knowing when to spend my septims, and when not to. I can't stand waste.

                I've taken the first steps toward doing so already.
                I met with several of the Dark Elves to discuss improvements in the Gray Quarter, but we have no real plans as of yet. 
                First we'll need to refill our coffers and stockpile stone and wood. The war took a heavy toll on Windhelm's resources.
                But I swore an oath to our Dunmer friends that, for as long as I sit on the throne of Windhelm, their needs will not be ignored.

                I almost didn't. I wasn't sure I could stomach having some Imperial tell me how to live my life.
                I was ready to pack my things when Hermir came to me. She wanted to make sure I'd finish teaching her the smithing trade.
                That girl's determination won me over. I suppose it didn't hurt that she said she only wanted to learn from the best smith in Skyrim.

                The Empire's elven puppetmasters never cared much for the idea of a human becoming a divine. So the worship of Talos is outlawed. 
                Skyrim doesn't take kindly to being told what to do. And to try and forget Talos, well... they may as well ordered us all to cut off our ears.

                Most of the folk in the city believe as Ulfric did, that outsiders should not be trusted.

                In fact, they didn't seem to care much for anyone who wasn't a Nord.

                Not only did I they take my bow, but they took all of our coin as well. Nothing's sacred to these people.

                Look. If you're trying to get to know me - don't. I don't like you, and I never will. It's nothing personal. But... 
                My wife trusts you, and I trust her judgment. So you can't be all bad.  
                Here's all you need to know: I'm a werewolf. I like killing things. I love Astrid. I hate annoying people. And the color blue gives me a headache.
            topic_info: 0006C3DF 
                I might ask the same of you. For you are more than mortal. You are moon-born. You are wolf.
                So you're a Companion, then? I can't imagine you got your gift anywhere else. I hope you have better luck with them than I did.
                Oh yes, I was once brother to the Companions. Let's just say they found my methods "unsettling." The Dark Brotherhood, obviously, feels differently. 
            topic_info: 0006C3E0 
                What a curious question. Well, I enjoy moonlit nights, taking long walks on the beach, knitting and unicorns.
                In fact, I once took a seaside stroll, on a moonlit night, and discovered a unicorn... which I proceeded to stab in the throat with a crochet needle.
                I'm a woman of refined, yet simple tastes.
            topic_info: 0006C3E1 
                I'm just a little girl! The Dark Brotherhood killed my mama and papa, and then they took me captive! Please, please help me!
                Rather convincing, don't you think?
                In truth, I'm no more a little girl than you are. I was once, of course. Three hundred years ago. Vampirism tends to keep one remarkably... fresh.
            topic_info: 0006C3E2 
                Hmph. I like to say I was born with a wand in my hand. Well, not literally - you can see how painful that would have been for mother.
                But I was a prodigy! Casting simple spells by one, completing complex incantations by three. Resurrecting corpses by seven! Ha!
                When I was thirteen I accidentally burned down the family home. A bit of lightning gone awry. Ah, but soon after I mastered my gifts. Completely.
                I went on to teach at the College - left after two years. Too simple. Too safe. None of them truly understood the glory of the Destruction school... 
            topic_info: 0006C3E3 
                Once, I was a Shadowscale. An assassin in service to the King of Black Marsh. Trained by the Dark Brotherhood since the day of my hatching.
                Ah, but that was a lifetime ago. Today, I am the last of my kind. My order is extinct. Now, I happily serve Astrid, and this Sanctuary.
                I am a trained killer, and once again have been given purpose. Life is good.
            topic_info: 0006C3E4 
                This Sanctuary has been my entire life since I was a young woman. That's when I first discovered my, shall we call it "aptitude," for elimination.
                I had an uncle, you see. He made certain... unwanted advances. So I killed him. And liked it. Then I killed again. And liked it even more. And so on.
                I was recruited by the Dark Brotherhood, and have been here ever since. I met my husband Arnbjorn, rose to leadership. And now here we are.
            topic_info: 0006C3E5 
                Ah, well, I'm Redguard, as I'm sure you've noticed. Though not like most of my kind you'll find in Skyrim, that's for damned sure.
                I am a child of Hammerfell, born of the sands of the mighty Alik'r. In that great desert, blood is a shade of crimson I can scarce describe.
                My past is long and storied, and not altogether proud. But the Dark Brotherhood saved me from myself. And I have never looked back.

                Yeah. Follow my wife's orders, and don't do anything stupid.
            topic_info: 0006C3EA 
                You must speak to that Muiri woman, correct? I have heard rumors in Windhelm. She was recently implicated in a thievery, along with her lover.
                The lover will likely be your target. If memory serves me correctly, he leads a group of bandits. So this may be rather interesting for you.
            topic_info: 0006C3EB 
                The contracts I dole out are fairly simple - go to a location, and kill the target. But this is different.
                The jobs Astrid gives you will be more important, and usually more complex. Just keep your wits about you. And for Sithis' sake, don't get killed.
            topic_info: 0006C3EC 
                You're headed to The Hag's Cure, right? It's a good shop. You should examine their wares. Never pass up the chance to buy a good potion... or poison.
                And one more thing. Have fun. You'll be committing a dark deed, but there's no reason you shouldn't enjoy yourself.
                You're only young once. Trust me, I know.
            topic_info: 0006C3ED 
                Yes. Just because you're now a professional assassin, don't think you have to skulk around in the dark like a skeever and stab people.
                Do what I do. Walk up to your target, introduce yourself, melt their skin off, and then run like the wind. Works every time.
            topic_info: 0006C3EE 
                You're being sent to meet with the contact directly, is that correct? What a most unusual occurrence. Astrid usually performs this duty herself.
                I can only assume she wants to test the full breadth of your abilities. So. Be polite, and professional, and represent us well.
            topic_info: 0006C3EF 
                She said that? If I find anyone working against my wife, or this Sanctuary, I'll beat them to death with their own severed head.
                Of course, they'd probably already be dead...
                But you know what I mean!
            topic_info: 0006C3F0 
                You're joking. While I can understand if some family members wish to honor the Old Ways once more, surely no one would oppose Astrid's rule.
            topic_info: 0006C3F1 
                Does she? Listen, brother... Astrid is my mistress, and I worship the ground she walks on. But this Cicero business has her a bit... paranoid.

                Oh! Well, I hope she doesn't suspect me. I mean, I've spoken with Cicero a bit, and he's quite charming. But I'd never go against Astrid. Never.
            topic_info: 0006C3F4 
                Ha! And would that surprise anyone? This Sanctuary's a mess. Wouldn't surprise me if somebody's talking to the fool on the sly. Making deals.
                And no, before you ask, it's not me. I know which side my bread is buttered on.
            topic_info: 0006C3F5 
                To what end? Usurping Astrid's authority as leader of the Sanctuary? Hmmm... Yes, I can see her concern. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
            topic_info: 0006C3F6 
                Oho! The Listener wants my counsel! I thought you were above the opinions of mere mortals, now that you commune with dead old women.
            topic_info: 0006C3F7 
                Just remember Astrid's commitment to her Sanctuary, to her Family. A Family that now counts you as one of its own. Honor Astrid above all others.
            topic_info: 0006C3F8 
                You may be the Listener, or you may just be a lunatic who's started hearing voices. Either way, Astrid is still your mistress. Not the Night Mother.
            topic_info: 0006C3F9 
                The man you need to speak with, his name is Motierre? That's a very old and powerful Breton family, firmly established in Cyrodiil. Most curious...
            topic_info: 0006C3FA 
                So you're the Listener, hmm? Well that hardly seems fair. You just got here. The Night Mother should have spoken to me. Any idiot could see that.
                But, I will serve gladly, as that's my lot in life. Now let's see. Ah yes, Volunruud. It's an old crypt, infested with Draugr. So plan accordingly.
            topic_info: 0006C3FB 
                If the Night Mother truly spoke to you, if you really are the Listener... your destiny was written in the Void. Astrid is right to fear your power.

                You've got to kill a soft little woman on her wedding day. What's next? Murdering a crippled orphan in his sleep?
            topic_info: 0006C3FD 
                Your contract sounds simple, which means it certainly will not be. Getting into that reception will be easy, but have you thought about getting out?
            topic_info: 0006C3FE 
                Slaughtering the Emperor's cousin? At her wedding? Those guards will be out for blood. Wouldn't surprise me if the crowd jumped in too.
            topic_info: 0006C3FF 
                It's no fair. I love weddings. Astrid should have given this contract to me. Instead, she's got me visiting cities, assessing security. How boring.
                But listen, I think I can help you. The wedding reception is outside the Temple of the Divines, right? In Solitude?
                If so, the bride will probably address the crowd from the balcony. It overlooks the courtyard.
                Well, there's an old statue there. I've seen it. Hanging right over where she'll be standing. Old means weak. Weak means it could fall. Hmmm?
            topic_info: 0006C400 
                Ah, killing her will be easy. She'll be so happy, she'll never see it coming. I should know, I killed a bride once.
                It was our honeymoon. Tepid, I said! The bathwater should be tepid! Lukewarm is not tepid! Close, maybe, but there's is a difference! Stupid cow.
            topic_info: 0006C401 
                I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of surveying the site of the reception.
                There's a small parapet, just opposite the balcony, that would prove an excellent spot for a long-range kill.
                I left something there for you. If you're inclined to take that approach.
            topic_info: 0006C402 
                What's the matter, Listener? Night Mother not feeling very chatty these days? You need help from your flesh and blood lessers?
                You've got to track a man, kill him, and then frame him for a crime. This contract's perfect... for me. Clearly, my lovely wife made a mistake.
            topic_info: 0006C403 
                Astrid had me investigate the Penitus Oculatus. Their members are highly trained, effective warriors. Be on your guard, brother.

                Killing Gaius Maro in a city will be challenging because of all the guards, but fights, even murder, are fairly common.
                Killing him secretly will certainly make things easier on you, but if there are witnesses, so be it.
            topic_info: 0006C406 
                Normally I talk to a victim before I end his life, but I wouldn't recommend it this time. Maro will be alert to danger. Talking may spook him.
            topic_info: 000749B6 
                I've taken the liberty of visiting the cities, and spreading some nasty rumors about Gaius Maro. To make his treachery that much more believable.
            topic_info: 0006C407 
                Remember, your target is Gaius Maro, the son. Not Commander Maro, the father! We need him alive. But the son... Ha! Scorch his face off!
            topic_info: 0006C409 
                Yes, do not underestimate Cicero. A man like that, small and foolish, is easy to mock. To underestimate. Don't make the same mistake I did.
            topic_info: 0006C40A 
                Going after Cicero now would be a fool's errand. That little jester is currently being digested in Arnbjorn's stomach, mark my words.
            topic_info: 0006C40B 
                Cicero destroyed any sympathy I may have had for him when he wounded Veezara. Kill the fool and be done with it.
            topic_info: 0006C40C 
                All right, so maybe I was wrong. Maybe Cicero coming here wasn't the best thing that could have happened. But even I didn't anticipate this.
                Well, you know the old saying. When life gives you lemons...
                ...go murder a clown.
            topic_info: 0006C40D 
                I feel only pity for Cicero. He must die, of course, but can any of us truly blame him for his actions? We mocked him, disrespected the Old Ways.
                Our actions were shameful. Surely, the Night Mother weeps this day.

                Hmph. I wouldn't worry too much about this Virane giving you the information you need. Give him a good scare, and he'll squawk like a Hagraven.
                That said... If your attack on Virane is witnessed, those Markarth guards are going to be none too happy...
            topic_info: 0006C411 
                Yes - don't kill the Gourmet!
                Oh, I know you have to, but it makes me sad all the same. I love the Gourmet's recipes. The world will soon be a blander, less flavorful place.
            topic_info: 0006C412 
                You've been directed to dispose of the Gourmet's body, is that correct? I often find water to be a suitable hiding place. A lake, a pool... the sea.

                Don't take any chances with this one. Use the Jarrin Root to poison the Emperor's food. You're disguising yourself as a chef - it only makes sense.

                Well... While it's true I prefer sorcery's more destructive nuances, we mustn't forget the many spells with simpler, more practical applications. 
                Sure, you poison the Emperor, but what then? Why not summon an Atronach to cause some chaos? Or turn invisible and slip away. Use your imagination!

                Two hundred years ago, I would have lain down my life for the Unholy Matron. But that is an age long since passed. Astrid is my matron now.
            topic_info: 0006C3D7 
                Without the Night Mother, there is no Dark Brotherhood. The Matron deserves our unwavering support and respect.
                Though I admit, I find her Keeper a bit too exuberant for my liking.
            topic_info: 0006C3D8 
                The witless fool and his pet corpse? Take a guess.
            topic_info: 0006C3D9 
                Their arrival is the best thing that's happened to this Sanctuary in years. Astrid is an effective leader, but we've been rudderless for too long.
                Scrounging for contracts, abandoning the Tenets. The Dark Brotherhood has been reduced to a group of common cutthroats. Frankly, it's embarrassing.
            topic_info: 0006C3DA 
                Truthfully? I'm not entirely sure. It's not that I don't have the utmost respect for Sithis, and the Night Mother, and the ancient ways. I do.
                But I've never been much for religion. I kill because it's what I've been trained to do. It's all I know. So long as Astrid is happy, I'm happy.
            topic_info: 0006C3DB 
                I don't like mimes, minstrels, thespians, acrobats, jugglers, troubadours or tumblers. Flutists give me a headache. I particularly hate jesters.
                As a rule, I'm also not crazy about the corpses of old women. For the Night Mother, I'll make an exception. But Astrid is the only mistress I serve.

                It's the peace treaty that ended the war with the Elves of the Aldmeri Dominion.
                The Dominion recognized the heresy of proclaiming Talos a god. Talos was a great man, and a great Emperor... but that does not make him a god.
                No matter how much the Stormcloaks may wish it were so.

                It's a great big festival put on by the bards, every year. They burn an effigy of old King Olaf. It's quite a bit of fun.
                The bards give out spiced wine during the festival, so they put in a big order. And then, for weeks after, demand is so high, I can barely keep up.
                But with the death of High King Torygg, the Festival has been declared "in poor taste." So it looks like it won't happen this year.

                Because Ulfric needed a symbol.
                Someone he could defeat that represented the Empire, the White-Gold Concordat, the banning of Talos worship.
                Torygg's father Istlod had held Skyrim together for nearly twenty-five years. When he died, Torygg became that symbol.

                Ulfric showed up at the gates of Solitude requesting an audience.
                We thought he was here to ask Torygg to declare independence. By the time we realized Ulfric was here to challenge Torygg... it was already too late.

                No. Even after Istlod died, the moot voted to make Torygg High King of Skyrim.
                But Ulfric was at that moot, continually talking about Skyrim's independence in terms just shy of treason.
                I don't think Ulfric knew how much Torygg respected him for that.
                If Ulfric had asked Torygg directly to stand up, to declare independence, Torygg might have done it.

                Because the Dominion is a sleeping beast that Skyrim cannot slay alone. Because many Nords are part of the Imperial army even now.
                Because the food and resources we get from the Empire are important to our people.
                Because even if we can't openly worship him, Talos the god was once Tiber Septim the man, and this is his Empire.
                And Torygg wasn't ready to let it fall apart.

                By Nord custom, once the challenge was issued in court, Torygg had no choice but to accept.
                Had he not, Ulfric would have had cause to call a new moot and a new vote for High King.
                Torygg had some martial training, of course, but it mattered little that day.
                When Ulfric's lips parted, when he unleashed the power of the Thu'um... That Shout, that ancient and terrible tongue... ripped Torygg asunder.

                I have no idea why, but one day, I told Roggvir I liked her. It was a stupid thing to do... He mocked me incessantly after that.
                From that point forward, every time Vivienne and I were anywhere close to each other, he made sure to humiliate me.
                He'd beat me up, dump mead on my head, anything he could get away with. Once he even slipped a beehive into my bed. 
                We were children, sure. But Roggvir never outgrew that immaturity, or his cruelty. So any talk about him being an "honorable" Nord? Pure folly.

                My loyalty lies with Solitude. So where Jarl Elisif leads, I follow.

                No. Although it's true my husband Torygg was the High King and I am his widow, I am in no position to claim such a title.
                Ulfric Stormcloak is victorious, and the Jarls have fallen in line.

                This land is riven by war, and her people suffer for it. The Stormcloaks are a blight on Skyrim, and like any blight... must be purged.

                With Ulfric's troops here, Elisif will be forced to support his bid for High King. He secures the position and appears above reproach.
                What's more, Ulfric's refusal to execute his slain enemy's wife will be portrayed as the ultimate act of compassion. Hmph. It's genius, really.

                They worry that Tullius is so focused on the war, that he risks forgetting what's best for our people.
                The real irony is that, while General Tullius is certainly no Nord, the people of Skyrim would be lost without him.

                No. That was an ugly affair. High King Torygg's death has turned the whole town on its head.
                And between you and me? He wasn't even that good a king. All of those rambling speeches about the Empire this, and the Empire that...

                Good evening. I'm Pantea Ateia, the Master Vocalist.

                It's been my honor to perform at the Blue Palace on many occasions. His late lordship was quite the admirer.

                If you ask me, this damned rebellion can't end soon enough. I had to end my tour of Skyrim's courts. Too dangerous too travel.

                To be honest, I simply can't stand some of my students. Only Aia shows true potential for greatness. The rest are just wasting my time.

                It takes two things to be a good teacher. The first is patience. The second is a firm wooden stick for rapping knuckles.

                Only reason I'm so good with a lute is because I'm old. It takes a lifetime to master.

                You here to apply at the Bards College? Well don't bother - you're too damned old. Start past four, and it's all wasted effort.

                My position, "Dean of History," actually covers a wide range of subjects. I teach poetry, writing, history, and the finer points of court life.

                That's right. In the Second Era, Tiber Septim himself led the army that conquered Old Hroldan from the barbarians of the Reach.

                Well done, indeed. This will be of great service. Understanding the enemy's position makes us all the more equipped to usurp it.

                Good work. Knowing more about the enemy's position makes it that much easier to take it from him.

                Suppose it's the same answer, either way. Winterhold's fallen on hard times, to say the least. Most folk packed up and left years ago.

                Look around you. Winterhold is in this state because of those damned mages.
                They sit up there in their tower, doing gods-know-what, and who watches over them?

                There's nothing left of Winterhold. Nothing!

                Just about eighty years ago, there was a terrible disaster. The cliffs overlooking the Sea of Ghosts collapsed, taking most of Winterhold with them.
                In the middle of it all, the College was practically untouched. Many of the survivors were suspicious.
                Some believed the mages were behind the whole thing, and others felt they could have at least prevented it.
                Arch-Mage Aren assures me that his people had nothing to do with it, and I believe him. But Winterhold never recovered.

                You may have noticed the College, just to the north there. Very prestigious place. Mages from all over Tamriel traveled here to seek knowledge.
                After the Oblivion Crisis was over, many felt that magic users were to blame. Elves, to be specific. It created a great deal of tension.
                A good many dark elves were driven from the city, and people became... uncomfortable with the presence of the College.

                I'm afraid the Winterhold you see before you is somewhat... underwhelming.
                I can assure you, though, that it was quite something in its prime. An early capital of Skyrim, you know.
                Sadly, the Oblivion Crisis took its toll on Winterhold, in more ways than one. Then, the Great Collapse swallowed most of our beloved city.
            topic_info: 00075355 
                What's there to tell? It's mostly gone now, thanks to those damned mages in the College.
                Someday there'll be proof they caused the Great Collapse. Most of a city just dropping off into the sea... That doesn't just happen.

                I'm afraid there's not much to be said. Winterhold is hardly what it used to be.
                You can talk to Birna if you need to buy anything. She doesn't have much, but could certainly use the coin. And then there's our little inn.
                Most of the business we get is from folks here to visit the College, though even that's dried up some.

                The Greybeards are a solitary lot. I don't think they've ever ventured outside their monastery.
                We get the occasional pilgrim passing through here on their way to the summit, but almost all of them have returned disappointed.
            topic_info: 0006770C 
                I've been to the monastery many times, but I've never even laid eyes on one of the Greybeards. Not that I'd care to.
                Being masters of the Thu'um, they could kill you by uttering a single word.
                Well, not that they would. They seem peaceful, but I wouldn't want to provoke them.

                Klimmek brings food supplies up to them once every few weeks when the weather permits it.

                It's frightening living below their monastery.
                Sometimes I swear I can hear strange noises rolling down from up there. It sounds like thunder, but there's never any rain.

                They call the path to the monastery the 7,000 Steps. Can you imagine?

                Until a few months ago, the girl was head over heels for Klimmek. Wouldn't stop talking about him.

                I didn't tell you this. Faleen likes to act tough, but she really has a soft spot for, of all things, poetry.
                You know, I took some classes at the Bards College as a youth. Poems come in handy when wooing.

                Mara has reflected an image to me. At the foot of the throat and young woman... almost a girl... her fickle love must resolve itself.
                The village of Ivarstead. The woman, Fastred. 
                This is the prayer heard by the goddess and relayed to her servants. Return when she has seen her path.
                I will entreat Mara on your behalf.

                The goddess smiles at your efforts, child. The dawn shines bright upon you.
                You have seen the young, fickle love of youth, and helped a more seasoned love find its way. 
                There is one final aspect we wish for you to explore. For a strong love can withstand storms and even survive death.
                Take this symbol of Mara. She will guide you to the wandering souls of two whose love was so great that their entwinement binds them to this world.

                The Dragonborn is an exception to all the rules - the Dragon Blood itself is a gift of the gods.
                If we accept one gift, how can we deny the other? As Dragonborn, you have received the ability to Shout directly from Akatosh.
                We therefore seek to guide you on the proper use of your gift, which transcends the restrictions which bind other mortals.

                That is commendable. But remember, the Dragon Blood is itself a gift of Akatosh. Do not try to deny that gift.
                Your destiny requires you to use your Voice - why else would Akatosh have bestowed this power upon you?
                If you remember to use your Voice in service to the purpose of Akatosh, you will remain true to the Way.

                The Voice was a gift of the goddess Kynareth, at the dawn of time. She gave mortals the ability to speak as dragons do.
                Although this gift has often been misused, the only true use of the Voice is for the worship and glory of the gods.
                True mastery of the Voice can only be achieved when your inner spirit is in harmony with your outward actions.
                In the contemplation of the sky, Kynareth's domain, and the practice of the Voice, we strive to achieve this balance.

                Dragons have always been able to Shout. Language is intrinsic to their very being.
                There is no difference in the dragon tongue between debating and fighting. Shouting comes as naturally to a dragon as breathing, or speaking.
                In mythic times, when mortalkind was in great need, the goddess Kynareth granted us the ability to speak as dragons do.
                For most people, long years of training are required to learn even the simplest Shout.
                But for you, the dragon speech is in your blood, and you learn it almost without effort.

                "By our breath we bestow it now to you in the name of Kyne, in the name of Shor, and in the name of Atmora of Old."

                I was assigned to Ulfric's guard. We were on our way to Darkwater Crossing, in the south of Eastmarch.
                The Imperials were waiting for us. As pretty an ambush as I ever saw. We were outnumbered five to one, at least.
                Ulfric ordered us to stop fighting. Didn't want us all to die for nothing, I guess.
                I thought they were taking us south to Cyrodiil. Parade us in front of the Emperor. But then we stopped in Helgen, and you know the rest.

                A masterstroke by General Tullius! He's only been in charge here for a few months, but he's turned things around for the Empire.
                We've been trying to catch Ulfric since the war started, but he always seemed to slip through our fingers... like he knew we were coming.
                This time, the General turned the tables on him. Ulfric rode right into our ambush with only a few bodyguards.
                He surrendered pretty meekly, too. So much for his death-or-glory reputation.
                I thought we were taking Ulfric back to Cyrodiil, but I guess the General changed his mind. You know the rest.

                The Thalmor ambassador delivered his ultimatum to the Emperor Titus Mede: the heads of every Blades agent within the Aldmeri Dominion.

                In the old tales, Nord heroes would use the power of their Voice to Shout down the gates of cities and strike down their enemies.
                But only the Greybeards study the Way of the Voice any more. If you can Shout... you need to talk to them.
            topic_info: 00029C24 
                Old Nord folk tales always talk about Shouting their enemies to pieces. I always thought it was just a myth.
                If you think you might be able to do that kind of thing, the Legion could certainly use your help.
                Go talk to the Greybeards, see what they can tell you.
            topic_info: 000ABD10 
                Well, I only know what I've heard in the old tales. Shouting is an ancient form of magic - the use of one's voice to project their power.
                If you can Shout, you need to go see the Greybeards. They'll know what to do.
            topic_info: 000BFC4A 
                I know more than most. I trained with the Greybeards at High Hrothgar when I was a boy.
                The Way of the Voice is an ancient, spiritual form of magic in which you project your vital essence into a "thu'um" or Shout.
                Most people would need to train for years before they could even attempt a single Shout.
                The Dragonborn is different - you have an inborn ability to Shout, the same way dragons are said to.

                Wulfharth was Dragonborn. Talos, too - the founder of the Empire, back in the good old days.
                In the very oldest tales, back from when there still were dragons in Skyrim, the Dragonborn would slay dragons and steal their power.
            topic_info: 000BFC4F 
                It means you have the Dragon Blood - you have an inborn ability to use your Voice the way dragons do.

                It seems those tales are true.

                It means you can kill dragons and steal their power - even speak with a dragon's voice, they say.
                There hasn't been a Dragonborn seen in the land for centuries. Not since Talos himself walked the 7,000 Steps to High Hrothgar.
            topic_info: 00029B01 
                I don't know much. Only the old tales about the ancient heroes who would use the Voice to defeat the enemies of Skyrim.
                They say the Emperors used to be Dragonborn, but that all ended when Martin died during the Oblivion Crisis.
                The Greybeards can tell you much more than I can. They're the masters of the Way of the Voice and taught Tiber Septim himself.

                Part of the cost of peace. Emperor Titus Mede saved his Empire at a very high price. A price that included the Blades.
                The Nords didn't like the peace treaty much either. Thirty years later, the Empire ends up with the Stormcloak rebellion on its hands.
                No doubt exactly as the Thalmor intended.

                But to answer your question, the White-Gold Concordat was the fancy name they put on the peace treaty between the Empire and the Thalmor.
                It ended the war and saved the Empire to fight another day.
                Also trampled on the sacred name of Talos, and gave the Thalmor free reign to stamp out Talos worship throughout the Empire.

                A few mortals are born with similar abilities -- whether a gift or a curse has been a matter of debate down through the centuries.
                What you have already learned in a few days took even the most gifted of us years to achieve.

                He's always used the ban on the worship of Talos to stir people up against the Empire.
                He never succeeded in getting much support, so a few months ago he murdered the High King! That got the Empire's attention.

                After the disaster at Red Mountain, where the Nord army was annihilated, he spent many years pondering the meaning of that terrible defeat.
                He finally came to realize that the gods had punished the Nords for their arrogant and blasphemous misuse of the Voice.
                He was the first to understand that the Voice should be used solely for the glory and worship of the gods, not the glory of men.

                They always hope to teach the Dragonborn to respect the Way of the Voice as they do. They never fully succeed.
                You'll have to make your own decision. It's a beautiful philosophy, but outside the seclusion of High Hrothgar, I was never able to hold to it.

                If they had their way, you'd do nothing but sit up on their mountain with them and talk to the sky, or whatever it is they do.
                The Greybeards are so afraid of power that they won't use it.
                Think about it. Have they tried to stop the civil war, or done anything about Alduin?
                No. And they're afraid of you, of your power.
                Trust me, there's no need to be afraid. Think of Tiber Septim. Do you think he'd have founded the Empire if he'd listened to the Greybeards?

                Return it here, to the Tiid-Ahraan. Then... Kelle vomindok. Nothing is certain with such things...
                But I believe the Scroll's bond with the Tiid-Ahraan will allow you a... a seeing, a vision of the moment of its creation.
                Then you will feel - know - Dragonrend, in the power of its first expression.

                The first mortals that I taught the Thu'um - the first Tongues. The leaders of the rebellion against Alduin.
                They were mighty, in their day. Even to attempt to defeat Alduin...  sahrot hunne. The Nords have had many heroes since, but none greater.

                Right, the leader of the Stormcloaks.
                They claim to be fighting for Skyrim's freedom, but the war is really all about Ulfric wanting to be High King of Skyrim.

                Oh, right, you were caught trying to cross the border into Skyrim, weren't you?
                You're not kidding. Ulfric's the leader of the Stormcloaks - you know, the traitors trying to break Skyrim away from the Empire.

                I used to dream of it. In the dream, I was standing... someplace high up... a tower, or mountain.
                It was always just before dawn. The whole world was in darkness.
        topic: 000B0BBD 
            topic_info: 000B0BC1 
                Then came the flash of light - just on the horizon, within the clouds that mark the border between worlds.
                It could have been lightning, but there was no thunder. In the dream, the sense of foreboding grew, but I could never wake up.
        topic: 000B0BBC 
            topic_info: 000B0BC0 
                Then it came again, this time more distinct. Closer. Definitely not lightning now. It was orange - brilliant orange, the color of hearth and dawn.
                And a sound, too. Distinct and indistinct. Not thunder... something else. Something I should recognize, but in the dream I cannot place it.

                I want to leave my high place, to seek shelter. From what, I don't yet know.
                In the manner of dreams, I cannot escape. I'm forced to wait and watch.
        topic: 000B0BBA 
            topic_info: 000B0BBF 
                Then, finally, realization and horror arrive together. The orange is flame, heat. The sound a roar, a challenge in their ancient tongue.
                But now it's too late for escape. The dragon is upon me - fire and darkness descending like a thunderbolt.
                And not just any dragon, but the Dragon - Alduin, the World-Eater, the dragon who devours both the living and the dead.

                And then I would wake up. And hope that it was just a dream... but know that it was not.

                If they had their way, you'd do nothing but sit up on their mountain with them and talk to the sky, or whatever it is they do.
                The Greybeards are so afraid of power that they won't use it.
                Think about it. Have they tried to stop the civil war, or done anything about Alduin?
                No. And they're afraid of you, of your power.
                Trust me, there's no need to be afraid. Think of Tiber Septim. Do you think he'd have founded the Empire if he'd listened to the Greybeards?

                The College has had enough trouble staying out of the war. No need to make it worse.
                You take that book to General Tullius or Ulfric and let them have their little triumph. It will be delivered back here to me soon enough.

                They live in seclusion near the top of the Throat of the World, the great mountain of Skyrim.
                They're masters of the Way of the Voice - of Shouting.
                It's a great honor for them to summon you. They speak to very few - in fact, they hardly speak at all.
            topic_info: 000C5225 
                No doubt. The appearance of a Dragonborn at this time is not an accident. Your destiny is surely bound up with the return of the dragons.
                You should focus on honing your Voice, and soon your path will be made clear.
            topic_info: 000C5226 
                The Voice was a gift of the goddess Kynareth, at the dawn of time. She gave mortals the ability to speak as dragons do.
                Although this gift has often been misused, the only true use of the Voice is for the worship and glory of the gods.
                True mastery of the Voice can only be achieved when your inner spirit is in harmony with your outward actions.
                In the contemplation of the sky, Kynareth's domain, and the practice of the Voice, we strive to achieve this balance.
            topic_info: 000C5227 
                We study the Way of the Voice, according to the teachings of our founder, Jurgen Windcaller.
                Very few are permitted to study with us here at High Hrothgar.
                But in your case, Dragonborn, it is a privilege to guide you towards mastery of your Voice.

                Exactly. Nobody even remembers our name these days.
                We used to be known across Tamriel as the protectors of the Septim Emperors. Those days are long gone, though.
                For the last two hundred years, we've been searching for the next Dragonborn to guide and guard, as we are sworn to do.
                But we never found one. Until now.

                The faction that rules the Aldmeri Dominion. The ones who almost destroyed the Empire during the Great War, thirty years back.
                There's no worse enemy to humankind in Tamriel. The Empire barely survived the last war. The Thalmor don't intend to lose the next one.

                He is the King in Rags. A man who once held all the Reach within his grip.
                He stokes the passions of the downtrodden in this city. Directs them to kill the enemies of the Forsworn in our name.
                All from inside Cidhna Mine. A Nord prison. The irony is quite thick.

                When their uprising was crushed, I had Madanach brought to me. He was a wild animal, but a useful one.
                I offered him a stay from execution if he used his influence to deal with any annoyances that came up. Competitors, agents, idiots.
                So I've let him run his little Forsworn rebellion from inside Cidhna Mine. Now he's out of control.

                Yes. It all started when I was a boy. My father owned one of the mines. Rare for anyone who isn't a Nord.
                He was killed. Guards said it was just a madman, but everyone knew the murderer was a member of the Forsworn.
                I've been trying to find out why ever since. Gotten nowhere so far, and then I got married. Have a child of my own on the way.
                I swore I was going to just give up, for my child's sake, but it's like my father's ghost is haunting me. Asking me "Why?"

                Before the Nords came, we worshipped the old gods, had our own kingdom.
                Times have been good and bad since then, but some folks couldn't handle not ruling their own land. Those are the Forsworn.
                The Forsworn follow the old ways, but some of those were best forgotten. Blood sacrifices, communing with Daedra. It's the road to ruin.

                It's the whole reason Ulfric revolted against the Empire. Well, the first reason anyway.
                Forsworn had taken over Markarth, and Ulfric and his men drove them out. Empire promised they'd be free to worship Talos afterwards.
                Pity no one told the Elves. Whole group of those Thalmor came and they demanded Ulfric's arrest.

                That's right. Whole group of the natives called the Forsworn rose up against the Nords. Drove them out.
                Then Ulfric Stormcloak came with his militia. That must have been a sight to see, him shouting folks to death.

                It all started here. This rebellion. When the Empire lost the Reach during the Great War, we became desperate.
                We promised a group of Nord militia free worship in exchange for their help retaking the Hold. Then the Elves found out about it.
                We were forced to arrest all of them. Ulfric Stormcloak, their leader, used the whole thing as proof that the Empire had abandoned Skyrim.
                The rebels called it "The Markarth Incident." It was the founding day for the Stormcloaks, and where this war really started.

                Through neglect. During the Great War, they let the unwashed natives retake the Reach and declare their own sovereignty.
                The Stormcloaks were forced to retake the Reach on our own, but that taste of independence emboldened them. And the Forsworn were born.
                In the end, we took back Markarth, but those damn Forsworn still stalk the hills and roads, looking for revenge.

                When the Aldmeri Dominion invaded the Imperial City, the Legion all but turned a blind eye to the other provinces.
                Many of the disgruntled natives of the Reach used the opportunity to depose the Empire, and founded what they called an independent kingdom.
                It was little more than a chaotic uprising, but the Reach was removed from Imperial authority for two years before we reclaimed it.
                But the leaders of the uprising refused our offers of peace. They fled into the hills and became the Forsworn.

                Calcelmo. He's the Jarl's magical advisor, but he spends most of his time studying the ruins.
                If you want in, Calcelmo has to give his say-so. He's usually in front of Nchuand-Zel. Just down the tunnel.

                Yes. Their history and culture is all around us in Markarth. A race of stonecutters, artisans, and engineers.
                They invented machines and built elaborate underground cities where they researched powers to rival the gods themselves.
                And then, at a time we are still not sure when, they disappeared. The whole people, all at once. Leaving behind only their works.

                Markarth is... different from the rest of Skyrim, there's no doubt about that. 
                The Reach has been part of Skyrim for a thousand years, but the Reachmen still haven't accepted it.
                It was only 20 years back that the Reachmen rebelled. Even took control of Markarth itself for a time.
                They were crushed, of course, but the survivors - the Forsworn - still lurk in the wilds and make the Reach dangerous for honest folk.

                It's an old city, I can tell you that. The Palace of the Kings is ancient.
                It's not the friendliest place for outsiders. The Dark Elves were all forced to live in a slum called the Gray Quarter.
                The Argonians can't even live inside the walls. They're all stuck out on the docks.
                Still, Candlehearth Hall's got decent food and cheap bunks. You could do worse.

                Ah, let's see, what else... The Bards College is here, and the main office of the East Empire Company.
                If you need it, you can get a room for a fair price at the Winking Skeever, just inside the main gate.

                Well, I know the Companions make their home here. Their mead hall, Jorrvaskr, is the oldest building in the city.
                Oh, and there's a nasty feud between two families called the Gray-Manes and Battle-Borns. You'll want to be careful there.
                The rest you can find out by asking the townsfolk. I'd start with the barkeep at the Bannered Mare, or the castle steward.

                The edged lexicon, for inscribing. To us, a hunk of metal. To the Dwemer, a full library of knowings. But... empty.
                Find Mzark and its sky-dome. The machinations there will read the Scroll and lay the lore upon the cube.

                An Elder Scroll is an instrument of immense knowledge and power.
                To read an Elder Scroll, a person must have the most rigorously trained mind, or else risk madness.
                Even so, the Divines usually take the reader's sight as a price.

                The simplest way to put it is "knowledge," but there's nothing simple about an Elder Scroll.
                It's a reflection of all possible futures and all possible pasts.
                Each reader sees different reflections through different lenses, and may come away with a very different reading.
                But at the same time, all of it is true. Even the falsehoods. Especially the falsehoods.

                The Scrolls exist here, with us, but also beyond and beneath. Before and after. They are bits of Divine made substance so we could know them.

                To glimpse the world inside an Elder Scroll can damage the eyes. Or the mind, as it has to Septimus.
                The Dwemer found a loophole, as they always do. To focus the knowledge away and inside without harm.
                Place the lexicon into their contraption and focus the knowings into it. When it brims with glow, bring it back and Septimus can read once more.

                He asks a price -- to work his will. A few murders, some dissent spread, a plague or two. For the secrets I can endure.
                In time, he brought me here. To the box.

                Inside is the heart. The heart of a god! The heart of you. And me. 
                But it was hidden away. Not by the Dwarves, you see. They were already gone. 
                Someone else. Unseen. Unknown. Found the heart, and with a flair for the ironical, used Dwarven trickery to lock it away.
                The scroll will give the deep vision needed to open it.
                For not even the strongest machinations of the Dwemer can hold off the all-sight given by an Elder Scroll.

                A panoply of their brethren could gather to form a facsimile. A trick. Something they didn't anticipate, no, not even them.
                The blood of Altmer, Bosmer, Dunmer, Falmer, and Orsimer. The elves still living provide the key.
                Bear you hence this extractor. It will drink the fresh blood of elves. Come when its set is complete.

                The final tempering of the Phial was performed with a type of old magic that's been lost since the Dragon War.

                With the heart of one of their Briar Warriors, I can lock the Phial's magic into its physical form.

                Now if you'll excuse me, I'm not quite in the mood to entertain guests. I trust you can show yourself out.
                Here's for your trouble.

                On top of the Throat of the World is a patch of snow that's never melted.
                They say the Greybeards taught it to ignore the sun, and heat simply washes over it.
                The original Phial was made from this snow. We'll only need a small bit for the repairs.

                I have some thoughts. There are three crucial elements. Some may be easier to find than others.
                On the top of the Throat of the World is a patch of Unmelting Snow. No heat can touch it.
                Then we need the tusk of a mammoth, ground to a fine powder as only the giants know how.
                The final step is tricky. It requires the briar heart from a Forsworn of the Reach.
                If you can bring me these materials, the Phial can again be made whole.

                A legendary bottle, forged in the days when Skyrim was just starting its turn to ice.
                A small container, made of the magically infused snow that first fell on the Throat of the World.
                It is said that the Phial will replenish whatever fluid is placed inside of it.
                For an alchemist like myself, it is the most pure expression of my art. To create from nothingness is... poetry.

                As for myself, I've always been content to simply be an alchemist. 
                I fear keeping the Phial would just remind me of Nurelion's obsession, and how it consumed him.
                Here, keep it. You are as much a part of its legend now as Curalmil was. I hope it brings you the happiness that my master desired.

                It brought me all the way to these frozen reaches from the warm embrace of Summerset Isle.
                Entire years spent in libraries. Seeking out tiny villages with local legends that contain but a whisper of a hint of the Phial.
                I even named my shop after it, hoping that it might attract anyone who had heard of it.
                And now it's within my grasp... but the Eight, it seems, have chosen me for their amusement.
                ... for in my current condition, I'll never be able to lay my hands on it.

                Hmmmm... "Fixed" is such a subjective term. I think "treated" is far more appropriate, don't you? Like one does to a rash, or an arrow in the face.
                Ah, but no matter. Heartless mortal that you are, you've actually succeeded and survived. I am forced to honor my end of the bargain.
                So congratulations! You're free to go!

                There is a certain beast in these lands. Large, majestic. 
                It's said that Hircine will commune with whoever slays it. I tracked it into these woods, but then had my... accident with the child.

                This is the Ring of Hircine. I was told it could let me control my transformations.
                Perhaps it used to. But I'll never know. Hircine didn't care for my taking it, and threw a curse on it.
                I put it on... and the changes just came to me. I could never guess when. It would be at the worst times.
                Like... with the little girl.

                I don't suppose there's a point in keeping the secret if I'm going to die in here anyway.
                I'm sure you've heard of men who shift to beasts under the influence of the moons. 
                I am one of them. A werewolf. It's my secret, and my shame.
                That's why I wanted the ring... it was said to give men like me control.
                Now I may look like a man, but I still feel the animal inside of me, as strong as ever.

                Believe me, it wasn't anything I ever intended to do. I just... lost control. 
                I tried to tell them, but none of them believe me.
                It's all on account of this blasted ring.

                I had just come into Falkreath. They needed some help working the mill, and I thought that would be something safe. Something I could do.
                When I saw the little girl, I was just... I could feel it coming on. I could taste the... I needed to hunt.
                But this pitiful, limited body wasn't meant for hunting. Slow. No claws. Weak, mashing teeth for chewing cud.
                I held in my rage as long as I could. But it boiled inside of me.
                She looked so fragile. Helpless prey. And then...
                I... I feel terrible about what happened. About what I did. It would probably be best for everyone if I just went away.

                There's an Altmer named Nelacar staying at the inn outside the College. You should ask him about it.

                I mentioned how the Star is a soul gem, only it never gets depleted? There's another rule the artifact follows.
                You can only store white souls in the Star, belonging to the lesser creatures. Azura's magic won't allow black souls to enter it.
                As a mortal, Malyn's soul was black, so part of his work was breaking past Azura's rules. He was close before... well, I already told you.

                Azura is no ordinary Daedra. She commands an entire realm inside of Oblivion. The more Malyn worked on the Star, the more she was able to damn him.
                It started slowly at first. Malyn would see things that weren't there. Then he would yell at students over words they hadn't said.
                Then one day I walked in and Malyn had... killed a student, and in a horrific moment of inspiration, he started using her soul for his work.

                He's already dead. Worse, the enchantment keeping him intact requires black souls. I don't know how many people he must have killed.
                If we don't do something, the enchantment will eventually fade, and the Star will slip back into Oblivion. Azura will have the last laugh.

                Precisely. But it's not as simple as enchanting Malyn away. He's put up barriers. Souls are only allowed in, not out.
                If we were to... somehow... send a soul inside the Star. One that was ready to overpower Malyn from the inside....

                Malyn wanted to alter the Star. He was dying. Disease. He thought he could store his own soul inside. Become immortal.
                It drove him mad. Students started dying. Eventually, the College exiled him. He took a few loyal disciples to Ilinalta's Deep and vanished.
                Look, I don't care who asked you to find the Star, but don't take it back to Azura. The Daedra are evil. They're the reason Malyn went insane.

                Interesting, to say the least. What with all that's been going on.
                On the one hand, supplies are harder to come by, since fewer traders are traveling the roads these days.
                But on the other, the scarcity of supplies has led to some, well, "elevated" prices.

                That is an old tale, but well known to those of us who serve in the keep.
                Long ago, there lived a mighty hero of the Nords. Olaf One-Eye. Olaf did battle with a fearsome dragon named Numinex.
                The struggle between Olaf and the dragon culminated in a mighty duel atop Mount Anthor, with Olaf the victor.
                Olaf returned in triumph to Whiterun. By his decree, the city's keep was rebuilt as a prison for Numinex.
                And so, from that time until this, our great keep has been called "Dragonsreach."

                Well, there are three of them. Arranged in three tiers, as you may have noticed.
                The Plains District is so named because it's the closest of the three to the plains that surround the city. The inn and marketplace are found there.
                Most of the city's residents live in the Wind District, which is the middle of the three.
                Dragonsreach occupies the highest, which we call the Cloud District. From here, the Jarl can see all that goes on within his city.

                The heat of battle is the fire that forges the strongest blades. It's an old Nord proverb.

                It wasn't my fault! I told them over and over that it was an accident!
                They wanted me to prove my worth, so they threw me up against a young whelp of a lad, hardly old enough to grow his first chin-hairs.
                I guess they thought a woman wasn't strong enough to hurt him. I didn't mean for him to die! Why would I want that? I just... lost control.

                We must also have ample reserves of water to combat the fires that will surely spread after an attack.
                But our greatest weapon? Courage. For if we cannot kill the beast, we must at least have the tenacity to drive it back.

                Hello, my friend! If you seek knowledge about mighty Talos, you have most certainly come to the right person.
                In mortal life, Talos was a Nord possessed of unmatched tactical skill, limitless wisdom and the power to see into men's hearts.
                Talos mastered the power of the Voice, and with it he united the lands of men into a great Empire.
                In southern lands, he was known by the name Tiber Septim. Here in Skyrim, we honor him by his proper Nord name.
                So great was his reign in life, when he ascended to the heavens he was made lord of the Divines.
                If you want to know more, I'm sure you can find any number of tomes on the subject.

                The history of Whiterun begins with Jorrvaskr, the hall of the Companions. For a long time, it was the only building on the mountain.
                As time passed, a thriving community sprang up around Jorrvaskr, as was common with mead halls.

                If it's the war you're referring to, I'm on the side of Whiterun.
                No doubt General Tullius and his friends in the Empire will tell you that I owe them my loyalty, and perhaps I do.
                Ulfric Stormcloak would say that I owe my allegiance to the Nord people as they fight for Skyrim's independence. Perhaps this is also true.
                The day might come when I am forced to draw my sword for one side or the other.
                But that day has not come yet.

                We've got small weapons as well as big. Maces, daggers, that sort of thing.
            topic_info: 00028499 
                You look like maybe you need a new weapon. Something big, perhaps? An axe maybe? Or a greatsword?
            topic_info: 0002849B 
                Most of our weapons were crafted by Adrianne Avenicci. My woman's an artist, is what she is.

                Crush, clobber, slash or slice. We've got a weapon for any occasion.

                Have you met my father? He was the steward, up at Dragonsreach when Balgruuf was Jarl.

                You think all the council my father provides the Jarl is his alone? Hmph. Let's just say I advise the advisor, and leave it at that.

                The task of Steward is more important than you realize. The Jarl often asks for my invaluable council.

                I refuse to believe Alva had anything to do with this. There is no way you can prove it to the Jarl.

                I thought Laelette left to join the war. I hadn't heard from her since she left.

                She began to spend a lot of time with Alva. Yet just a week before, she despised her.
                In fact, the night she disappeared, she was supposed to meet Alva.
                Alva told me later that she never showed up. I never got to tell her good bye.

                Laelette was told to burn mommy and me, but she didn't want to.
                She wanted to play with me forever and ever.
                She kissed me on the neck, and I got so cold that the fire didn't even hurt.
                Laelette thought she could take me and keep me, but she can't. I'm all burned up.
                I'm tired. I'm going to sleep for a while now.

                They were worshippers of Mehrunes Dagon, the Daedric Lord of Destruction and Change.

                A little history, first. After the Oblivion Crisis, a number of groups cropped up dedicated to wiping out the remnants of the Mythic Dawn.
                One of these groups found Mehrunes' Razor, the artifact of Dagon. They split it into three fragments and pledged to keep them apart forever.
                That was almost 150 years ago, and the pieces are still being kept by the descendants of that group. And they're right here, in Skyrim.

                It's no secret that my family were once members of the Mythic Dawn. One of my forefathers was even chosen to assassinate Uriel Septim himself.
                We hid from our past for years, became tradesman, people of coin and influence.
                But I realized that the Mythic Dawn's importance -- our importance -- to history cannot be denied.
                I'll see everyone in Tamriel remember that for a moment, we held the fate of the world in our hands, for good or ill.

                The Sybil of Dibella spends her entire life in direct communion with the goddess.
                From the time she's a little girl to the moment she expires, she is a direct connection with the heavenly mother. 
                From her reverie, we know the mind of our god.
                We have had a vision of the next Sybil, living in a village to the north. She must be brought to the temple for her reverie to begin.

                The ceremony you so rudely interrupted was the Exalted Protocol of the Dibellan Sybil.
                I don't expect you to know what that means. 
                Suffice to say that our Sybil was recently lost to us.
                Through the Protocol, we have seen the home of the next Sybil, to the north, in a small village pressed against the stone.
                If you can travel there, and retrieve our young Sybil, your transgression will be forgiven.

                The effects have already been felt. The Icerunner has failed to dock on time.
                Without the Lighthouse, the Icerunner will have swung wide of the western shoal and run aground on the eastern coast.
                My sister Deeja will be at the wreck with our Blackblood Marauders. She knows to expect you.

                With the war, many more ships come through these docks. Loaded with weapons and pay, but few people. And they pass through dangerous waters.
                We have an interest in one of those boats, the Icerunner.
                The Solitude Lighthouse will be guiding it in... but if its fire were to go out, the Icerunner would run aground.

                Of course not! Thieves take what is precious. Thieves steal.
                We just take what will not be missed. What no one needs anymore. Maybe we take some weapons and stop a few deaths. Who would call that thievery?

                Nords don't care much for magic. The College in Winterhold is about the only place it's not looked down on.
                Otherwise you could talk to the Jarl's pet wizard in Solitude.

                The College of Winterhold is the only place in Skyrim open-minded enough to teach magic.
                Although Ulfric's court wizard has been known to take on apprentices once in a while.

                Magic? Goodness, not here! Nothing dangerous like that! That's all kept to that College up in Winterhold.

                Magic is for the weak. Elves, I mean. They keep to that College in Winterhold. They know their place.
                Of course there is Farengar. He might be the Jarl's wizard, but at least he's a Nord.

                Pfft, I should've guessed as much. Your kind sticks to that College in Winterhold, as well they should.

                I've got no interest in magic users. No use for their kind at all. They're way up north in Winterhold, and that's fine with me.
                I don't even like our Jarl havin' a  court wizard.
            topic_info: 0008EC3D 
                Bit of advice, folks here don't care for magic or those that use it. If you're intent on it, check at the College up in Winterhold.
                Either that or go see the Jarl's court wizard.

                Head north to Winterhold. There's a College there, they teach magic. Most Nords don't care for them.

                The good people of Skyrim on occasion would rather pass judgment than attempt to understand what we do here.

                It is true there are some here who have spent years studying the accumulated knowledge of the scrolls.

                So, as I was saying, the first thing to understand is that magic is, by its very nature, volatile and dangerous.
                Unless you can control it, it can and will destroy you.

                Of course, my dear. Of course. You all certainly possess some inherent natural ability. That much is not being questioned.
                What I'm talking about is true control, mastery of magic. It takes years, if not decades, of practice and study.

                With the Emperor's arrival in Skyrim now a certainty, the Imperial Legion will need to begin its preparations immediately.
                Security is being handled by a man named Voltus Agallon. His job is to travel throughout Skyrim, and ensure each city is prepared for Mede's visit.
                You must find and kill Voltus Agallon. Doing so will disrupt security sufficiently that we will be able to, eventually, get to to the Emperor.

                Agallon is an efficient man, and will certainly already have begun his tour of Skyrim. Unfortunately, we don't have his schedule.
                So, you've got two options. Try to find Agallon yourself, somewhere on his route between the major cities. Or... find and steal his schedule.
                You'll find that in his office, in the Legion stronghold of Dragon Bridge. It's your choice. Now go, and may Sithis speed you.

                Half of Skyrim knows. Old hag gets butchered in her own orphanage? Things like that tend to get around.
                Oh, but don't misunderstand. I'm not criticizing. It was a good kill. Old crone had it coming. And you saved a group of urchins, to boot. 
                Ah, but there is a slight... problem.

                This is a public kill. How you do it is entirely up to you. Arrow to the throat? Knife in the belly? Your choice, so long as it's loud and messy.
                Because of the current political climate, people are going to assume the murder is related to the bad blood between the Legion and Stormcloaks.
                In any event, when Vici dies, it's going to be complete pandemonium. Best have your escape route planned out in advance.

                And I think we'd both agree, Cicero's brought quite enough madness to this Sanctuary.

                The wedding is being held in that city, at the Temple of the Divines. Her death will cause an uproar, which is exactly what we want.

                But by Sithis, I hope I'm making the right choice here. You may be an effective killer, but your command of guile leaves much to be desired.
                The sealed letter you delivered to me was mysteriously unsealed upon its arrival. I can only assume you've read its contents. Sloppy...

                As a matter of fact, I do. Two of them. One rather easy assignment, and another that should prove quite a challenge.
                Your first target is an Orc bard named Lurbuk. The other is a vampire by the name of Hern.

                Very little. You have my word on that. The Night Mother represents a chapter in the Dark Brotherhood's history that has long since been closed.
                Today we live by our own rules. We're the last Sanctuary in all of Tamriel, and only by forgoing the old ways have we survived for so long. 
                My only worry is her "Keeper." I'm not sure what Cicero expects to gain by bringing the Night Mother here, but he'll soon learn this is my Sanctuary.

                Search Cicero's room. Maybe there's something in there that sheds some light on where he might have gone.
                Let me know the minute you find something. I've got to see to Veezara, and calm everyone down.

                Hmph. He had a trip to Skyrim planned for months, and canceled at the last minute. Much to his cousin's dismay.
                Seems the Emperor realized his presence would necessitate a more direct role in the ongoing hostilities. A role he was, obviously, unwilling to take.
                All that will change with his cousin's murder. Everyone will think it was motivated by the conflict between the Imperial Legion and Stormcloaks.
                And the Emperor will be forced to come clean up the mess.

                Cicero will cite our independence as the need to revert to the Old Ways. He'll claim we're undisciplined, unruly. Heretical, even.

                I'm arranging a job for you, but I need some more time. For now, go talk to Nazir. He may have some smaller contracts to tide you over.
                Soon, the Night Mother will arrive. And things around here are sure to get even more interesting.
                Ah, but one last thing. A welcome home present. The armor of the Dark Brotherhood. May it serve you well in all your... endeavors.

                Well, what happens now is you start your new life in the Dark Brotherhood. You're part of the Family, after all.
                This, as you can see, is our Sanctuary. You won't find a safer place in all of Skyrim. So get comfortable.

                All it takes is one taste, and the effects are quite immediate. The Emperor will be serving Sithis before he even knows he's dead.
                Once Mede has been killed, escape through the upper door, and across the bridge. I've "arranged" for it to be unguarded once the alarm is sounded.

                In any event, here's my advice. Go to Riften's Ratway, find Delvin Mallory. I believe Astrid had you visit him once before, no?
                Mallory is an expert "obtainer of goods." We can use the money to repair and refit this Sanctuary. Make a true home for us, eh?

                That can have interesting results. Some victims may flee, others may cower in fear.

                Cicero's problem isn't his madness. It's an adherence to an ancient, outmoded way of life. The Night Mother's ways... simply are not our ways.

                Obeying the Night Mother. You being the Listener. It's ridiculous. No offense.
                Cicero may have overheard me talking to one of the others about the Night Mother. It's possible I was... not entirely respectful.
                But to go this far. To attempt to murder the leader of a Sanctuary. Cicero must pay with his life. There is no other option.

                Yes. A few months ago I received word from the Night Mother's Keeper that he had arrived in Skyrim from Cyrodiil. 
                The Night Mother's crypt, in Bravil, was destroyed. A result of the chaos caused by the war with the Thalmor. That forced a relocation.

                They used to come from the Night Mother. Potential clients would perform the Black Sacrament, and she would hear their prayers.
                The Night Mother would communicate this to the Listener, who would then dispatch a Speaker to arrange the contract with the client.
                But that was a long time ago. There hasn't been a Listener in years, not since Cyrodiil was overrun in the war with the Thalmor.
                But people don't know that. So they still perform the ritual... and we eventually hear about it. When someone wants us, we find out.

                Hmph. Yes. Yes, I believe you are. Very well, then.
                You need to find and kill Safia, the captain of the pirate ship Red Wave.
                The ship travels the northern coast, and sometimes isn't even in Skyrim at all. So you'll have to be patient. Good luck.

                To kill the Emperor of Tamriel... The Dark Brotherhood hasn't done such a thing since the assassination of Pelagius.
                As a matter of fact, no one has dared assassinate an Emperor of Tamriel since the murder of Uriel Septim, and that was two hundred years ago...

                And, there's only one man who can give us what we need - Delvin Mallory. He's a fence, a private operator. Works out of the Ratway, in Riften.
                Give me the letter. Bring Mallory the amulet. Find out everything you can, and sell it if he's willing. He'll offer a letter of credit - that's fine.

                Yes. Gaius Maro, on orders from his father, arranged for the Gourmet to come to Skyrim months ago. To serve as the Emperor's personal chef.
                But the Emperor canceled his journey at the last minute. Maro was smart, kept the Gourmet around, in case things changed.
                And so, the Gourmet has remained in seclusion, somewhere in Skyrim... on indefinite hold. Probably feels like a prisoner. But you'll fix that.

                "Uncommon Taste." It was published a few years ago, and became a sensation throughout the Empire almost overnight.
                The recipes were hailed as both practical and decadent.
                I've made a few of the Gourmet's dishes myself, actually. His roast mutton with Redguard berry sauce is to die for.

                But I do realize it's sometimes not that easy. You may want to make a statement, or a contract may require a public killing.
                Murder is, obviously, a very serious crime, and a very high bounty will be put on your head in the hold where the act was committed.
                You can run, obviously, but you'll still have a price on your head. If a guard attacks, you can attempt to yield by sheathing your weapon.
                If the guard accepts, you can serve your time in a cell, or pay your bounty. We've all gone through it. We do what we must to survive.
                But, there is another option. Some members of the Thieves Guild in Riften can get their bounties... erased. For a price. Something to think about.

                If you say Cicero has gone there, it stands to reason that he's familiar with the place. That means you'll be fighting him on his own ground.

                It's true, I'm afraid. Cicero was a little whirlwind, slashing this way and that. It would have been funny, if he weren't trying to murder us all.

                In my time, the Blades protected the Emperor. It would seem these Penitus Oculatus will prove equally incompetent.

                Stalking your prey, planting false evidence, destroying an innocent man's reputation. Truly a contract worthy of the Listener.

                The Keeper is a sacred position within the Dark Brotherhood. Ask yourself - do you trust the wisdom of our Lady?

                I will kill this jester if you so desire, but there is a disturbance in the Void. Our Dread Father does not wish this.

                Killing the Gourmet will leave an emptiness in the collective soul of Skyrim. This pleases me.
            topic_info: 000DDDD2 
                Yes. Kill the chef, and then steal his very identity. For that is the true death.

                A poison stew, eh? I was always partial to apples, myself.

                An ancient city, Markarth. Build by the Dwemer, the dwarves of old. To think, an entire race... eradicated. Not even I can take credit for that feat.

                You see, that little Aretino boy was looking for the Dark Brotherhood. For me, and my associates.
                Grelod the Kind was, by all rights, a Dark Brotherhood contract. A kill... that you stole.
                A kill you must repay.
            topic_info: 0002AD09 
                We need to talk.
            topic_info: 0002AD0A 
                Look. Something is happening here. I'm not sure entirely what that something is, but... Well, we need to find out.
                If the Night Mother really did give you an order to talk to a contact, we'd be mad to ignore it.
                And I think we'd both agree, Cicero's brought quite enough madness to this Sanctuary.
                So go. Go to Volunruud. It's a crypt, pretty far to the northeast. Talk to this Amaund Motierre. And let's see where all this leads. Hmm?
            topic_info: 0002D8A1

                With Vici's murder, you've started us down a path the Dark Brotherhood hasn't traveled in centuries. The assassination of an Emperor.
                And now, your reward. A unique spell to summon a legend of the Dark Brotherhood. His soul serves us now in death, as his body once did in life.
                Ah, and of course, a bonus, for killing Vici while she addressed her guests, as instructed. Gold... simple and pure. Spend it as you will.
                Now then. Time to proceed to the next stage of the plan. Go and speak with Gabriella. She's been helping me arrange your next contract.

                Excellent. Once again, you've proven yourself a born assassin.
                Tell you what. Why don't you hold onto Shadowmere a while longer? He's a fine steed, and hasn't been ridden nearly as much as he should lately.
                And now that this Cicero mess has been mopped up, we can get back to the matter at hand, hmm?
            topic_info: 0006D288

                Oh yes, it is Cicero! You were a fool to spare me. What, did you think I would be grateful? Cicero should be Listener! Not you! Now you will die!
                ...
                Ahhh.... gotcha! Oh, Listener, you should see the look on your face! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
                Oh, Cicero has returned! Not to kill the kind Listener, but to serve, until one of us dies horribly, in service to our Mother! Best friends forever!
                In the meantime, I'll make myself at home in the Sanctuary. I'm sure Mother needs... tending.

                Hard to say. The weather's taken a bit of a turn, here.
                Haldyn's been known to obscure his hideaways with magic. 
                If we take care of him, the way should be clear to properly assault the island.

                So if you're willing to perform one more service for the Company, we could put this matter behind us for good.

                Haldyn will take my hide for this, but Skyrim's been feeling a bit confining lately.
                We draw council at Japhet's Folly. The fools in Windhelm won't go near it, which is fine by us.
                If you'll pardon me now, my crew needs gathering. Should be in Hammerfell before the other Horkers know who let slip their secret.

                Get to Dawnstar and see what you can find out about these rogues. I'd wager they won't be too far from the tavern.
                Try to find out where their fortress is. The captain, Stig Salt-Plank, has to know something.

                Not yet, no. But perhaps an intrepid person such as yourself could help with that.
                They have a dark elf who oversees their operations. Suvaris Atheron. 
                She's meticulous to a fault, and keeps a logbook with every transaction she makes.

                The most dangerous sort of man -- quick to anger, but patient in exacting vengeance.
                He also has a fearsome control of Destruction magic.

                My plan was to take the horse from our lodge and deliver it to Letrush at the stables. Obviously, that didn't exactly work out as I'd planned...

                Ah, well, I recently approached Sibbi Black-Briar about buying Frost, one of the finest breeding horses in Skyrim. He agreed to sell.
                I paid Sibbi half the cost of Frost up front, but before he could deliver, Maven had him locked up. Sibbi believes this exempts him from our deal.
                It does not.
                I want you to talk to Sibbi for me. Then, I want you to bring me Frost and the Lineage Papers that prove the horse's worth.

                Guess I should have known. Maven and Sibbi have been at odds ever since she had him tossed into jail.
                Look, if I were you, I'd proceed carefully. Crossin' Maven is one of the first things you learn not to do when you're down here.
                As far as the Guild's concerned this is between Sibbi and Maven, so we're going to officially stay out of it.
            topic_info: 000D6C42 
                So Sibbi finally got the nerve to bare his teeth, eh?
                Look, this sounds like a family matter and I don't want the Guild in the middle of it. You do what you want.
                Just don't expect us to at your back when Maven has your head on the executioner's block.

                Anything that confirms that Thorald isn't dead, but is being held captive. I know those Battle-Borns have it.
                They'd be hiding it, of course. Wouldn't want it to get out that they've been lying this whole time.

                But he's not. I just know it. The Imperials captured him, and they're holding him someplace. The Battle-Borns know where.
                I'd go and search their house for proof, but they want me too. I'd be captured, and then we'll never know what happened to him.

                It's hardly a secret that they have ties to the Empire, and hate anyone who speaks out against it.
                Thorald did worse. He took action against the Empire, and the Battle-Borns knew it.

                The Battle-Borns. The Emperor's biggest boot-lickers here in Whiterun.
                Their connections to the Empire and the Legion are well-known. When Thorald didn't return home, there was no question in my mind.
                They knew Thorald supported the Stormcloaks, knew he was going to aid them in battle. Made sure he didn't come back.

                What's there to say? You go against the Empire, you wind up dead. Thorald got what was coming to him.
                Best not to ask too many questions about it. People might get the wrong idea about you.

                Between the two of us, his family is better off thinking he's dead.
                Thorald and I have history, all right? We used to be friends. So I looked into it when he disappeared.
                I found out the Thalmor have him. And they don't let anyone go.
                So I've kept my mouth shut. Like I said, his family is better off believing he's gone, because he's never coming back.
            topic_info: 00027F63

                They wanted a confession. To what didn't matter, they simply wanted me to admit to something.
                I think they wanted to break me. Use me as a way to get to the rest of the Gray-Mane family.

                At last. I can rest safely. You have done me a great service, warrior. I cannot thank you enough.
                Take this reward. I managed to sneak some of my wealth out of Hammerfell when I left. It's the least I can do.
                For now, I will maintain my ruse here. You are always welcome in the Bannered Mare.

                Disciples of Kynareth could sense something holy in it, and traveled far to hear the winds of the goddess in its branches.
                Of course, not as many pilgrims these days.

                A big dead tree isn't very inspiring if you're coming to worship the divine of wind and rains.
                Kynareth gives life, and we need a living tree to be her symbol.

                I've thought about that... Trees like this never really die. They only slumber.
                I think if we had some of the sap from the parent tree, we could wake up its child.
                But even if you could get to the Eldergleam, you couldn't tap it. Not with any normal metal.

                Reclaiming Hjaalmarch lets me worry less about the rear guard, and push more men to the front. It was a mistake to let Ulfric control it for so long.
            topic_info: 000E6C4A 
                It was important we reclaimed the Reach. Letting Ulfric control the flow of silver was a mistake. One I'm glad we've finally corrected.
            topic_info: 000E6C4B 
                I'm glad we've finally restored the Pale. It was extremely foolish giving the Empire control of another port.
            topic_info: 000E6C4C 
                I'm glad we liberated the Rift. It was dangerous having Imperials skulking about on the southern border of Eastmarch.
            topic_info: 000E6C51 
                I'm glad we've taken back Winterhold. While the Imperials were up there, important resources were tied up stiffening our northern border.

                My parents were traveling merchants eventually settling in Cyrodiil. I must have inherited their wanderlust...
                I joined the Legion to see the world. I know, that's one of those things people say, but it's completely true in my case.
                Wasn't long before I saw more of the world than I bargained for.

                Home? Home to me is a hot cup of ale at the end of the day and five minutes without someone needing something from me...
                Cyrodiil is a beautiful place, full of diverse peoples and histories. But so too, Hammerfell and Skyrim, and every other place I've been.
                Don't get me wrong, every country has its dark corners. But that's why we're here. To bring order and civilization, and to protect the people.

                The life of a soldier is full of hardship. That's nothing.
                But they send the Legion to places that've gotten too bad to be settled without violence. What's hard is seeing good people warped by evil.
                And I've seen the face of evil. It was in the air above Sentinel on the Night of Green Fire.

                Ulfric and his thugs are stirring up trouble for their own agenda. The Empire is the only thing keeping the Dominion from walking all over Skyrim.
                It matters little if some of the people here are ignorant to that truth. They are still citizens of the Empire. It's our solemn duty to protect them.

                Back in 42 I was stationed in Hammerfell, on leave in Sentinel, trying to track down some refugee relatives who had fled persecution in Alinor.
                Suddenly an explosion of magic in the refugee quarter. Thalmor mages were attacking the Altmer dissidents who were resisting with magic of their own.
                I ran to the scene with other Legionaries who where stationed there, but the entire quarter was a smoking ruin by the time we arrived.
                Everyone was dead. Wholesale slaughter. The Dominion, not content with killing dissidents at home, came to Hammerfell to finish the job.
                We're supposedly at peace now. But I put in to be stationed here to keep an eye on the Thalmor. I've a feeling they're behind this unrest in Skyrim.

            topic_info: 00017DD1 
                First problem here is a pack of Imperial dogs drooling over resources stolen from the people. A little sabotage will sour the taste of that victory.

            topic_info: 000221EA 
                Soldiers win wars, but where to put them is the key. We have word of an enemy courier in the area. We aim to confiscate his documents.
            topic_info: 00017DC2 
                And then, it seems an Imperial worm wiggles it's way back home, carrying information stolen from us. We need to steal it back.
            topic_info: 000221E7 
                And perhaps more importantly, I need to break one of our boys out of a rebel controlled fort.
            topic_info: 00017DC3 
                And perhaps more importantly, we have a brother rotting in an Imperial prison. He won't languish in there long, will he now?
            topic_info: 00015494 
                And we have an opportunity to slay the rebel field commander. Without a clear command structure, they should fall into confusion and disarray.
            topic_info: 00017DC4 
                We also have the opportunity to slay an Imperial Legate. That'll put fear and confusion into those faithless dogs.

                And we understand a rebel garrison is close to abandoning the resistance. We need to send them a little encouragement.

                Ulfric, too, once. He wasn't always a self-serving ego-maniac. He fought in the Imperial army in the War against the Dominion.
                But Ulfric and his "Stormcloaks" are deluding themselves. If there's any hope of a long term victory against the Dominion, it's in the Empire.

                True, he didn't stand a chance against me.
                But that was precisely the point! He was a puppet-king of the Empire , not a High King of Skyrim.
                His father before him perhaps, but not Torygg. 
                He was too privileged and too foolish, more interested in entertaining his queen than ruling his country.

                For too long he's been hand-picked by the Emperor, and given emphatic nods by milk-drinking Jarls addicted to Imperial coin.

                By holding onto Falkreath, we control access to the Reach, Whiterun, and the Rift. Ulfric will try for it soon. We'll be there to stop him.

                Taking the Pale gives us another port in Dawnstar, and puts us within striking distance of Windhelm. That should make Ulfric a bit more cautious, eh?

                Now that the Empire has been driven from the Reach we can put a stop to the raping of her silver mines. That silver belongs in Skyrim.
            topic_info: 000A6D10 
                The Empire's ravenous hunger for Skyrim's silver makes them fierce. But rest assured, we'll win the Reach and wrest it from their greedy paws.
            topic_info: 000A6D14 
                Tullius must be getting nervous. Taking Hjaalmarch we're practically in his backyard now. As soon as we're able, we'll march on Solitude.
            topic_info: 000A6D1F 
                We should take Hjaalmarch. It'll be an important pressure point on the Imperials. We'd be within spitting distance of the capital.
            topic_info: 000A6D21 
                We've driven the Imperials out of Whiterun. This is good. Very good. We now control the center. It's a powerful position. One I aim to keep.
            topic_info: 000A6D29 
                The Imperials have really dug into Whiterun. We'll wrest it from them soon enough. We must. Its central position is key.
            topic_info: 000A6D2A 
                I'm proud we liberated Falkreath from the Empire. In many ways it's the heart and soul of Skyrim. Not to mention its rather strategic position.
            topic_info: 000A6D2B 
                The Empire thinks it holds Falkreath from us. But the souls of Skyrim's bravest are buried there and will fill our hearts and strengthen our blades.
            topic_info: 000A6D2C 
                Tullius has camps in the Pale, entertaining thoughts of battle. The Empire still underestimates the force of our cause. It will be their undoing.
            topic_info: 000A6D2D 
                I can't believe we let them take the Pale. Losing the port of Dawnstar is lessened only by the threat of Imperial forces being so close to Windhelm.
            topic_info: 000A6D2E 
                I'm not sure why Tullius is wasting his time trying to take Winterhold from us. But if he wants to throw his men away, I'll gladly accept that gift.
            topic_info: 000A6D2F 
                I don't like Imperial troops holed up in Winterhold... such a close march to Windhelm. So I'm sending a campaign up there to take it back.
            topic_info: 000A6D38 
                Damn Tullius. He's pocketed men in the Rift. It's dangerous having Imperials skulking about on the southern border of Eastmarch.
            topic_info: 000A6D39 
                Losing the Rift gives Tullius easy access to the south of Eastmarch. Talos preserve us. We must take it back!

                I guess you had your reasons.
            topic_info: 00039C32 
                None of my business.
            topic_info: 000D3E9B 
                I don't think there's a need for that!
            topic_info: 00039C33 
                Was that really necessary?
            topic_info: 000D3E9C 
                Why are you doing that?
        topic: 00039C2D 
            topic_info: 00039C3F 
                Guess they deserved it...

            topic_info: 000D3609 
                Well... that was an unpleasant bit of business.
            topic_info: 00039C41 
                I didn't know you were so cold-blooded...

            topic_info: 0006CE31 
                What are you doing that for?
            topic_info: 00039C37 
                You could have just asked.
            topic_info: 00039C38 
                I saw you do that, you know.
        topic: 00039C2B 
            topic_info: 00039C39 
                Help yourself, by all means. Who cares if I starve?
            topic_info: 00091707 
                Don't worry about it. Keep it.
            topic_info: 00039C3A 
                I guess you can have that.
            topic_info: 000D360C 
                You must really need that.
            topic_info: 000D3E93 
                I'll look the other way this time.
            topic_info: 0006AE43 
                I didn't really want that anyway.
            topic_info: 000D3E94 
                I suppose that's yours now.
            topic_info: 00039C3B 
                Oh, what a clever thief you are.
            topic_info: 00091708 
                You could have asked before just taking it.
            topic_info: 0006CE33 
                You could have just asked.
            topic_info: 0006CE3C

            topic_info: 00039C3C 
                You really shouldn't be in here, but I guess since it's you...
            topic_info: 00039C3D 
                I'll let you stay. This time.
            topic_info: 0006AE40 
                If you were anyone else, I'd make you leave.
            topic_info: 0006AE41 
                You're not really supposed to... you know, be here.
            topic_info: 00039C3E 
                You know you're not supposed to be in here right now.
            topic_info: 000D360D 
                You're not really allowed in here, you know.

                It is our sacred duty to study the Elder Scrolls.
                We read these ancient scrolls of prophecy in order to divine the future, and we use that knowledge to aid the Emperor.
                Sometimes we venture out into the world in search of more scrolls for our library at the White-Gold Tower.
                That is the very purpose that first brought me to Skyrim.

                It is the great spire at the heart of the Imperial City, among the tallest towers in all of Tamriel.
                The lower floors are home to the Imperial Council, and the Order of Moth Priests occupies the middle floors.
                The tower suffered damage in the recent war with the Aldmeri Dominion, and is not what it once was.
                I hope one day to see it restored to its former glory.

                Not as much as I would like. Even after spending decades of my life in study of the Elder Scrolls, they remain a great mystery to me.
                It's true for most of my brothers in the order as well. We don't really know where the scrolls came from or who wrote them.
                What we do know is that some are born with the special gift to read the Elder Scrolls.
                These chosen few can divine events of the past and future within the scrolls, though in time, it drives us to blindness.
                I'm afraid there's not much more to tell. Even today, the Elder Scrolls remain a great enigma.

                You're not paying attention then. Like most everyone else around here.
                Haven't you heard that the Hall of the Vigilants was destroyed by vampires? They never took the threat seriously, and now they've paid the price.

                The Vigilants mostly hunt down daedra worshippers, which is why they got torn to pieces when they went up against vampires.
                That's why our leader Isran is reestablishing the Dawnguard. Real, serious vampire hunters.

                Changed your mind, huh? The Dawnguard could use somebody like you.

                Ha. Isran's going to like you. He's up the hill in the fort. He'll decide if you're Dawnguard material.

                Ha. Isran's going to like you. Go talk to him at Fort Dawnguard, southeast of Riften. He'll decide if you're Dawnguard material.

                That's what everybody says, right up until they find their throat being ripped out by a pack of hungry vampires.

                Never seen a crossbow before, eh? Not surprised. Kind of a Dawnguard specialty. Nothing better for putting down vampires.

                Here, take this one and give it a try. You'll want to get to know how to use it if you really plan to join the Dawnguard.

                Well, well. You made it. Good. Isran's in the fort. He'll get you sorted out.
            topic_info: 0200D90A 
                Report to Isran at Fort Dawnguard. And get moving if you're serious about it. The vampires aren't going to wait around to make their next move.

                Heard they're reforming the Dawnguard. Vampire hunters or something, in the old fort near Riften. Might consider joining up myself.

                They say that vampires attacked the Hall of the Vigilant. Burned it to the ground! Never heard of vampires doing anything like that before.

                It's not safe out there. Horrible creatures attacking towns in the night... If they won't let me in, at least I can stay here.
            topic_info: 02019910 
                Look at the size of that fort. They must have room for a few more in there.
            topic_info: 02019911 
                I worry it'll never be safe to go home.
            topic_info: 02019912 
                If the Dawnguard can't stop these vampires, who can?
            topic_info: 02019913 
                I hope Alvide doesn't think less of me, but I can't protect her on my own. We're safer here.
            topic_info: 02019914 
                Why can't they just let us in? We won't get in the way!
            topic_info: 02019915 
                I've no love for living out of a tent, but I'll take that over being ripped apart.
            topic_info: 02019916 
                It looks like this is as close as we're going to get being safe from the vampires.
            topic_info: 02019917 
                Barknar insisted we come here, said we'd be safe. He also said we'd be inside the walls.
            topic_info: 02019918 
                What if the vampires come here, after the Dawnguard? We'll be stuck right in the middle.
            topic_info: 02019919 
                I hope we can go home soon. I don't like it here.
            topic_info: 0201991A 
                At least Barknar and I are here together.
            topic_info: 0201991B 
                Thought I'd come here to be safe. Now they won't so much as let us in.
            topic_info: 0201991C 
                How hard would it be to feed a few extra mouths? I'm sure they can manage, and not leave us sitting out here like cattle.
            topic_info: 0201991D 
                I won't beg for protection, but I'm not even sure that would work with this Isran.
            topic_info: 0201991E 
                Aren't the Dawnguard here to help, to make it safe for us? Can't see why they wouldn't let us in.

                Well, it started with the followers of Mehrunes Dagon having Emperor Uriel Septim VII assassinated.
                Without a Septim on the throne of the Empire, Dagon was able to leave Oblivion through the gates and attack.

                This meant that we were vulnerable to the forces of Oblivion.

                That was a dark time in my life. I did a lot of things I ended up regretting.
                Maybe that's why I worked so hard to redeem myself once I was freed.

                I murdered others for money. And before you think I belonged to some romantic or secretive guild, think again.
                I was simply an addict who needed money for skooma. The stuff wasn't cheap, and murder always seemed to be in demand.

                I finally bit off more than I could chew.
                I was paid to assassinate some high-ranking official from House Redoran.
                What I didn't know is someone had hired the Morag Tong to kill him as well.

                Exactly.
                He got to my target first and called the guard to cover his tracks. By the time I got there, the place was on alert.
                Walked right into a trap, and didn't even realize it until I was captured.

                They tried me for murder, threw me on a prison ship and sent me to the jail in Vivec City.

                I began to explore what the dovah call "Alok-Dilon," the ancient forbidden art that you call necromancy.

                Only thing that stood out for me was Auriel's Bow. That's a powerful weapon, and I sure as Oblivion don't want the vampires to get hold of it.
                The Moth Priest can stay here for now. As for the vampire, I still don't trust it, so keep it on a leash.

                Only what I've heard.
                Back in the Second Era, the Jarl of Riften had a son. Adventurous type, too much for his own good it seems.
                Wound up turning into a vampire. The Jarl, unable to kill his own son, spent a fortune building this keep and hiring men to guard it.
                Their job was to keep the Jarl's son contained within. They took it seriously, and served honorably.
                They were eventually forced to put him down. The Jarl banished them from the hold, but they stuck to their cause.
                Fought vampires wherever they found them. I aim to continue that mission.

                I've only heard stories. Not sure if any of them are true.
                Like that they were supposed to guard some vampire here, but wound up all becoming vampires themselves when they saw how powerful he was.
                And then preyed on the Rift until finally someone put them down.
                I guess it doesn't matter now. At least Isran is trying to do something noble with the name.

                Oh, I've read a few things. Heard a few more things. Arkay's told me a bit as well.
                The story they'd like you to believe is that they were such a noble bunch, doing the honorable thing and saving lives.
                Only I hear that's not quite how it happened. Secret organization, you see. No one to blame when homes are broken into, things stolen.
                Heard they'd go on midnight raids, pillaging and looting, and then stash the spoils somewhere, guarded by their sigil.
                Arkay tells me the Sun Fire spell can break open those caches, but I've never found one. I think he might be lying to me.

                Another elf, I see. I'm sure Vingalmo will be sizing you up as we speak, trying to figure if you're friend or foe.
                He'll tell you what a monster I am, that I can't be trusted... You mark my words, it's him you need to worry about.
                If it'll get him closer to being in charge, he'll slit your throat without a moment's thought.

                As a vampire, you will gain new powers, but also a weakness to sunlight.
                With each passing day that you do not feed, that weakness will become more deadly, but your powers will also become stronger.
                Feed upon those who are sleeping, and your vulnerability to sunlight will diminish along with your powers.

            topic_info: 02015C86 
                Do you need something?
            topic_info: 020128A7 
                Lord Harkon will finally have his wish... to see the prophecy fulfilled. Then we will all benefit.
            topic_info: 020128A6 
                Can we really trust the words of this Moth Priest? What if he's just lying to save his worthless skin?
            topic_info: 020128A5 
                All this talk of Elder Scrolls and Auriel's Bow... Lord Harkon's ambition truly is great.

                Parading around in that form won't do you any good here.
            topic_info: 02004DEF

            topic_info: 02010D84

            topic_info: 02011E44

                While the blessed state of undeath can be "accidentally" conferred - consider the brutish creatures you find wailing in dank hovels in the wild...
                Only those who can trace their ancestry through Harkon's mortal blood line can faithfully accept the power conferred by his Vampiric blood.
                And among those, it seems, only when the heavens show the correct aspects.
            topic_info: 0200A295 
                Because he himself bestowed upon you a portion of his vitality when he infused you with his own blood the night you returned with Serana.

                Our blood grants us power to calm and relax. If you currently lack the gift, forgo feeding for a day and that power will come naturally.
                Once your thrall is suitably sedated, you will be able to impart the gift without resistance.

                They're a splinter group of the "Vigilants of Stendarr." A bit more ambitious, it seems.
                The Dawnguard are apparently focused on exterminating vampires, noble and brute alike.
                Not a serious threat, but we can't leave them completely unchecked or they may become one.
            topic_info: 02015E0D 
                A more "serious" group of the Vigilants of Stendarr. Sometimes when you skin a skeever, you find he has a more aggressive mate.
                The Dawnguard apparently like killing vampires.
                Almost as much as we like killing them.

                This isn't that watered down child's power that you simply contract from another vampire. We're pureblood creations of original vampires.

                The first vampire came from Molag Bal. She... was not a willing subject. But she was still the first.
                Molag Bal is a powerful daedric lord, and his will is made reality. 
                For those willing to subjugate themselves, he will still bestow the gift, but they must be powerful in their own right before earning his trust.

                Looks like you know your daedra.
                What you might not know is that for the most devoted and impressive followers, Molag Bal will give the gift anew, in its pure form.

                Let's not revisit that.

                The land is near Giants' Gap, right on the border with Whiterun Hold. You'll almost be in sight of the Loreius Farm, in fact.

            topic_info: 0300BE08 
                Yes. It's on the north coast of Hjaalmarch, with a magnificent view of Solitude on its crag. Just the place for a new manor house.

                Excellent. Then I grant you a title to the land.
            topic_info: 0300BE03 
                Excellent. We're glad to have you as a landowner in Hjaalmarch. Here's the title to your steading.
                If you don't mind getting your feet wet, your best bet is to head north past the mill. The odd tomb or two along the way won't bother you.
                The land is on the coast, across the Karth delta from Solitude. An inspiring location, as you'll see.

                They're... dead.
                My pa was a sailor. Took me with him on his last trip. After he got sick, they... put us off here and left without us.
                He... died a few days later. I've tried to make do since then, but... it's been hard. Real hard.

                Both my parents were in the Legion. There was... an ambush.
                Katla said she'd feed me if I could make myself useful. I take care of the animals, run errands, that kind of thing.
                I guess it could be worse. But... I'm sick of sleeping outside with the horses. I want a real home, real parents. Not... this.

                Long story, but I don't see the harm in sharing it with you.
                My last patron was a true Nord. He was dressed in animal skins, had tattoos on his face...  a real traditional type, if you know what I mean.
                He had an insatiable bloodlust and was extremely stubborn... one of the toughest employers I've ever had.

                Simple... he paid well. Very well.
                Anyway, we'd just cleared a ruined fort somewhere outside of Whiterun and when we got outside, we saw one of them galloping away on horseback.
                Well, my boss wasn't about to let him get away, so we pursued... on foot, for three days.

                Until we ended up tracking him to one of the largest bandit encampments I'd ever seen.
                My patron took one look at me, and made the most menacing grin I'd ever seen.
                At that moment, I knew I'd never see him again. No amount of money would ever be worth that kind of death.

                This is Dusty. I personally trained her from a larva. Feels like a lifetime ago now.
                She hasn't been in traveling condition for quite a while now. I've tried to let her go off on her own but she insists on staying here.

                The blast from the volcano wiped most of them out.
                Found Dusty here in a small cave on Vvardenfell. Silt Strider cocoons are pretty tough.

                Mostly for transporting goods and people. They were pretty commonplace in Morrowind, but that was ages ago.
                A Silt Strider carapace is so strong it can withstand the harshest of weather.
                Even the legendary sandstorms of Vvardenfell's Molag Amur Region were said to barely make a dent in them. Of course, that's all ash now.

                We get by trading odds and ends with the locals. I've decided to stay here and make sure she passes in peace. It's the least I can do for her.
                Every once in a while a local makes it out here. Although, they usually just want to catch a glimpse of Dusty. Silt Striders are pretty rare now.

                If you have to ask that, you'd probably be best leaving his books to wiser heads than yours.
                Like all Daedric Princes, he's not to be trifled with. But he is subtler than most of his ilk, appropriate for the prince of knowledge and fate.
                Many scholars and loremasters have been ensnared by the lure of learning the secrets that only Hermaeus Mora possesses.
                But don't worry. I have no intention of joining them in their endless search through the infinite halls of Apocrypha.

                Hermaeus Mora has always tried to seduce mortals into his service with the lure of forbidden knowledge.
                Where the Black Books actually came from... no one really knows. Some appear to have been written far in the past, others might be from the future.
                Apparently time is more malleable if you're the Daedric Prince of fate and destiny.

                He also is searching for them. In fact, he has already found one. He showed it to me when he came here.
                It was very like the one you found in Miraak's temple. A thing of dark magic, not of the All-Maker.

                Much of what was known has been lost to the ages. He was Dragonborn, and yet he served the Dragons.
                A priest in their order, highly esteemed and very powerful.
                Then he turned against them, becoming something they feared. He was defeated long ago, but it seems he was never destroyed.

                Our traditions do not speak of them. But they and Miraak are connected. You read a Black Book, and saw him.
                And the book's power comes from the same dark source as that which corrupted the Wind Stone.
                But beware. You are now walking the same road as Miraak.

                The power of the Stone had been corrupted. It was the source of the influence that had taken control of the Skaal.
                Your Shout broke whatever evil will controlled the Stone, and restored its true nature as a conduit of the All-Maker's gifts.
                Freeing the other Stones will diminish whatever dark influence is spreading across Solstheim.

                I can feel it. The balance of the living land has nearly been restored.
                But while the Tree Stone remains under Miraak's influence, the natural order remains out of balance.
                And all can be undone if Miraak exerts his will again. You must continue on your path, and gather the knowledge you need to defeat him.
            topic_info: 0402BF36 
                Yes. There are six sacred Stones - Wind, Water, Earth, Beast, Sun, and Tree. Through them the Oneness of the land is maintained.
                Frea saw that the Tree Stone now stands imprisoned in Miraak's new temple. I doubt you can free it until his power is broken.
                But you may be able to cleanse the other Stones. Even if this does not stop Miraak, it surely will delay his return.

                It used to be one of the richest ebony mines in Morrowind, but it dried out years ago.

                Solstheim is theoretically under my rule, but without revenue from the mine, I lack the resources to actually govern anything but Raven Rock itself.

                Well, there's a small enclave of Nords to the north at Skaal Village. They pretty much keep to themselves, and we both like it that way.
                Then there's Tel Mithryn to the east. The Telvanni live over there... sort of a strange lot, but since we're both from Morrowind, we get along.
                Other than that, Solstheim is crawling with bandits and Reiklings, but that's to be expected living on the frontier like this.

                After we left Morrowind, we found ourselves in Skyrim.
                We wandered around a bit and ended up in Morthal where we took temporary residence with Lami, the town's alchemist.
                I was fascinated by her work, and over a period of a few years she taught me quite a bit.

                When word reached us that a settlement of Dunmer was forming on Solstheim, we were thrilled.

                We lived in a settlement perhaps a league from the border of Black Marsh, the homeland of the Argonians. 
                Even though the Argonian Invasion ended a long time ago, there are still a few scale-skin clans that live within our borders.
                To put it simply, they attacked our settlement and slaughtered almost everyone. It was horrible.

                I wish I had a more romantic tale to tell, but I was simply seeking my fortune and chose Raven Rock to ply my trade.
                Besides, knowing how to repair bonemold armor wasn't very useful in Riften.

                Spent a lot of time with the guy swapping smithing techniques. Learned a heck of a lot, including how to repair bonemold.
                After he moved on to greener pastures, I decided to pack up, move out here and put those lessons to the test. Been here ever since.

                Not at all. I used to fish the waters around Solstheim. Made a damn fine living at it, too.
                But over the years, the ash from Red Mountain poisoned the sea up there and the fishing became difficult.
                If it weren't for my supply runs to Raven Rock, I'd have likely sold my ship by now and moved back to Riften.

                Crescius is a third-generation miner... all his life, he's lived and breathed nothing else.
                By the time Crescius came of age, the ebony mine in Raven Rock was shut down. He took that quite hard.

                Our home has been in his family for over two hundred years. Leaving would have been like abandoning precious memories.
                Instead, he stayed on Solstheim and spent most of his life prospecting for a new ebony source. Sadly, it never surfaced.
                A decade ago, this drove him into a deep depression. He shut himself inside his home and refused to come out.

                It was. After refusing to allow anyone to bring him food, Councilor Morvayn ordered his door to be knocked down before Crescius starved to death.
                I was a Temple priest at the time, and they had me use my healing arts to restore strength to his ailing body.

                It's an island northeast of here. Has a small dark elf town called Raven Rock and a handful of Nords living in Skaal Village.

                Nobody seems certain why it happened... an attempt at expansion, revenge for the enslavement of their people or perhaps both.
                Whatever the case may be, thousands of Dunmer needlessly lost their lives and many more were exiled from their homeland.

                I was one of the wealthiest miners in town... I could haul up almost three or four times what the average digger could.
                I never saw the end coming like it did... the mine running out of ebony.
                Unlike most of my fellow miners, I was too foolish to save enough coin for that day. The rest I spent on sujamma to drown my sorrows.
                Councilor Morvayn was kind enough to allow Rirns and I to live in one of the abandoned buildings. At least it keeps the ash out of our eyes.

                They sprung from the ground with no warning and killed one of my companions instantly. I was so frightened, I ran all the way back to Raven Rock.
                Unfortunately, I'd left the other guardsman behind and he never made it. Captain Veleth discharged me from service.

                A few years ago, I was walking down by the docks and I noticed a Dunmer staggering along with a bottle of sujamma in hand.
                He was one of my patrons, and liked to drink heavily, so I wasn't exactly surprised.

                As I'm watching this spectacle, a netch floats over the Bulwark towards him. 
                The man looks straight up at the netch... yells "have a drink" and tosses the bottle... and it never hit the ground.

                Well, the bottle broke on the netch, and it must have swallowed its contents because it started floating sort of tilted.
                Finally, it stopped and began to quiver. A few moments later, the foulest liquid to ever assail your nostrils spewed from its maw.
                I've seen plenty of drunks in my day, and I'll tell you right now that netch was sick.

                Sotha Sil, Almalexia and Vivec represent what was... beings who won the Dunmer people's hearts with their actions, but blinded them just the same.
                They were aberrations, false prophets. They used their status as heroes to shield the True Tribunal from our minds.
                But now that they've been destroyed, the light can finally shine upon the House of Reclamations.

                As you can imagine, the eruption of the Red Mountain took an awful toll on Solstheim.
                Hunting for game has been scarce, and the waters are apparently too tainted for fishing.
                According to Councilor Morvayn, my husband's been Raven Rock's most important food source for decades.

                It's an island northeast of here. Has a small dark elf town called Raven Rock and a handful of Nords living in Skaal Village.
