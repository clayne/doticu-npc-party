                In a fight, if you see a big wind up, get out of the way or bash him with your shield. Attacks like that go right through a regular block.
            topic_info: 000DBA31 
                When the other guy has his shield up, regular blows are useless. Wind up and hit him with a really powerful attack to get past that shield.
            topic_info: 000DBA32 
                Even if your opponent doesn't have a shield, those big, powerful blows can stagger him. Leaves him open for a quick follow up blow.

                Using two weapons means you've got no defense. You can't block anything. But if you hit him with both at the same time, he may not get up again.

                Ah, yes. The courier. I guess you know my secret ingredient for that spiced beef, now.

                You buy a war dog from me? There's a reason why my hounds are so eager to bite into people.

                That's right. You're the sellsword. Thank you again. It's so nice to have help with my husband gone. Shame what happened to him.

                One of my customers? Did you know I inherited the store from my late husband? Shame what happened to him. He had such good taste.

                Looks like you've got some help already. I'll join you, but you'll have to let your comrade go. What do you say?

                If you need some skulls crushed, I'm still available for hire.
            topic_info: 00104F33 
                It's good to see you. If you need my help again, it's the same fee as always.

                Well met, friend. It's good to see you're still in one piece, with all the trouble you get into.
            topic_info: 000BCC89 
                I'm what you'd call of soldier of fortune. Make me an offer, and I just might fight at your side.
            topic_info: 000BCC8B 
                Can't be too careful these days, with the war and other dangers. For a fair price, I'll watch your back.
            topic_info: 000BCC8A 
                If you've got the gold to pay my fee, then my sword-arm is yours.
            topic_info: 000BCC8D 
                Some call me a mercenary, but I like to think of myself as a freelance adventurer for hire.
            topic_info: 000BCC8E 
                My skill in battle is unmatched. Fortunately for you, that skill can be bought.
            topic_info: 000BDB50 
                Why hire a common soldier to protect you when you can have a master of the arcane?
            topic_info: 000BDB4F 
                The only thing better than a powerful mage fighting at your side is... well, nothing, really.
            topic_info: 000BCC91 
                If it's a mercenary you're looking for, you've found him. There's no stronger sword-arm for hire in all Skyrim.
            topic_info: 000BDB51 
                For a modest fee, I'll bring my formidable arcane powers to bear against your foes. What do you say?
            topic_info: 000BDFB4 
                If you're looking to hire the strongest mercenary in Skyrim, I'd wager your search is over.
            topic_info: 000BDFB3 
                Sell-swords are common in Skyrim, but you'll find precious few as stout and as a strong as I am.
            topic_info: 000BCC90 
                Blade and shadow, silence and death - these are my arts. For a modest fee, I'll make great art for you.
            topic_info: 000BDFB5 
                I've fought in more battles than I've got years of life in me. Pay my fee and I'll put that experience to work for you, friend.
            topic_info: 000BDFB7 
                I know nothing of fear, and nothing of remorse. Pay my fee, and together we will vanquish any foe.
            topic_info: 000BDFB6 
                Death is my art, and like all artists, I seek a patron. For a mere handful of gold, I will follow you into any danger.
            topic_info: 000BCC8F 
                By blade or by spell, if you want it dead, I'll make it dead. All you need to do is pay my fee.
            topic_info: 000BDFB8 
                I am a lethal instrument, yours to command for a modest sum. I suggest you hire me before one of your enemies does.
            topic_info: 0001A18C 
                I fight with both blade and spell. You might say I'm equipped to handle nearly any threat. So, shall we talk price?
            topic_info: 0001A18B 
                Sure, you can hire a swordsman or a spellcaster to fight at your side, but why not get both for the price of one?
            topic_info: 0006552C 
                Good to see you again! How would you like to hire a brave, if untested, mercenary?
            topic_info: 0001A18D 
                Versatility is the key to survival. Hire me, and you'll be well -prepared to face threats both magical and mundane.
            topic_info: 0006552E 
                It just feels right somehow, having this new life as an adventurer. It's what I was meant to do.
            topic_info: 0006552D 
                At first I thought I'd miss farming. I guess I've had my fill of it, because I don't miss it at all.
            topic_info: 0006552F 
                This new armor fits me like a glove.
            topic_info: 00065530 
                If I can make enough money here in Skyrim, I think I'll travel to Hammerfell and see what work I can get there.

            topic_info: 00099396 
                Fight with us and you'll have stories to tell. Come up to Jorrvaskr if you're worth anything in a fight.
            topic_info: 00023E46 
                Here to be a Companion? Well, they just let me in, so there's probably no more room.
            topic_info: 00023E47 
                I was the newest Companion, until you came along. I guess that's ok. Just means I can show you the ropes!

                Oh, hey there. I killed a bear yesterday. Did you kill anything?
            topic_info: 000BFCC3

            topic_info: 000347B8 
                I wonder why the Dwemer came to Skyrim. Why did they build this place? I suppose we'll never know.
            topic_info: 000347CB 
                Do these steel walls and strange Dwemer devices make you uneasy? Perhaps it's just me.
            topic_info: 000347E5 
                I've heard that you can sell Dwemer artifacts on the black market down in Cyrodiil. They fetch a handsome price, too.
            topic_info: 000CD83C 
                This place is amazing! It's hard to believe that mortal hands built them.

                The stories don't say why the dwarves disappeared. I wonder if their machines turned on them.

                If my ma could see me now, she'd scold me good. She'd tell me I should know better than to go poking around in abandoned forts.

                Did you bring a torch? These old forts can get pretty dark inside.
            topic_info: 000347F9 
                There are forts like this all over Skyrim. The Imperials abandoned most of them a long time ago.
            topic_info: 000347FB 
                Just look at this place. I've seen better workmanship from Nord children only ten winters old.
            topic_info: 000347FD 
                So this is what passes for Imperial craftsmanship. Try not to sneeze, or you might bring the whole fort down.
            topic_info: 00034802

            topic_info: 000CD843 
                I can see why they built the fort here. A small force could control most of the nearby land.

                There is no greater madness than those who seek to become vampires. That's a dark bargain if there ever was one.

            topic_info: 0003E301 
                I'd rather fight bandits than draugr. At least bandits know when to stay dead.
            topic_info: 000CD84B 
                Taken alone, the draugr aren't so fearsome. They're far more deadly in greater numbers.
            topic_info: 000CD84C 
                These Forsworn are just savages. They live in caves and ruins when civilized folk build towns and cities.

                You can't argue with these mages. They'll attack you on sight.

                It probably took some Dwemer craftsman a year to build one of those things.

                These ruins and their mechanical inhabitants are all that remain of the Dwemer.
            topic_info: 0003E322 
                It's said that the Forsworn make dark pacts with the Hagravens, and that is why they can use magic.

                These Forsworn don't even have the decency to dress right.
            topic_info: 000CD84F 
                Draugr are slow and clumsy. Hardly a challenge for a man like me.
            topic_info: 0003E327 
                I would find the Dwemers' mechanical guardians fascinating if they didn't try to kill everything on sight.

                Lost the last one I gave you? Very well, here you are. Mara keep you.
            topic_info: 00026B7F 
                I'm sorry, but even Mara's Temple needs coin. We will have a symbol ready for you when you come back with enough gold.

                An Amulet of Mara? I haven't seen such a thing in a very long time.
            topic_info: 000CD875 
                You go ahead and arrange the wedding ceremony when you're ready.
            topic_info: 00075CA3 
                You've embarrassed the temple and spat in the face of love. What do you want?
            topic_info: 00026B3E 
                Is that an Amulet of Mara? I'm surprised someone like you isn't spoken for.
            topic_info: 000CD86F 
                An Amulet of Mara? You're not married? Surprising.
            topic_info: 000CD870 
                That amulet. I've seen the Nords wear these when they're looking to marry. With your strength, you should have no trouble.
            topic_info: 000CD871 
                Is that Lady Mara's amulet? I'm shocked a fine person like you isn't married already.
            topic_info: 000CD872 
                You're wearing Mara's amulet? You? I'd marry you. I'd marry you twice.
            topic_info: 000CD873 
                Look at you. Wearing an Amulet of Mara. Are you saying you're available?
            topic_info: 000CD874 
                An Amulet of Mara, you're looking for marriage, then?
            topic_info: 00026B5B 
                You should arrange the ceremony at the Temple of Mara right away. I can't wait.
            topic_info: 000CD877 
                Have you spoken to the Temple of Mara, yet? I'm so excited.
            topic_info: 000CD876 
                You should speak to the priest in the Temple of Mara to arrange the ceremony. No sense waiting.
            topic_info: 000CD87B 
                I'll see you at our wedding!
            topic_info: 000CD878 
                Hey, shouldn't you tell the Temple of Mara that we're getting married? Be hard to have a wedding without a priest.
            topic_info: 000CD879 
                Now shouldn't you be off arranging our wedding day? Don't keep me waiting.
            topic_info: 000CD87A 
                You should tell the priest we're getting married. They'll take things from there.
            topic_info: 000CD87D 
                Never thought I'd get married under a Nord god. But with you, it feels right.

                Been itching for a fight.
            topic_info: 000A6BB5 
                I promise a swift but painful end!
            topic_info: 000A7283

            topic_info: 000A728D 
                That was fun.
            topic_info: 000A728E 
                Waste of time.
            topic_info: 000A728F 
                Didn't even work up a sweat.
            topic_info: 000A7290 
                Pathetic.
            topic_info: 000A7291 
                That's what happens when you cross the Guild.
            topic_info: 000A7293

            topic_info: 000A7294 
                Damn, just as I was getting warmed up.
            topic_info: 000A7295 
                I hardly felt a thing.
            topic_info: 000A7296 
                And that's why I'm the best.
            topic_info: 000A6923 
                The afterlife will bring you darkness.
            topic_info: 000A6927 
                Bless you, Lady of Shadows... I live another day.
            topic_info: 000A6956 
                I send you to your rest.
            topic_info: 000A6957 
                You were no match for a Nightingale.
            topic_info: 000A695C 
                Shadows consume you.
            topic_info: 000A695D 
                That wasn't a fight, it was an execution.
            topic_info: 000A695E 
                So ends the lesson.
            topic_info: 000A6ABC 
                That was hardly worth my time.
            topic_info: 000A6ADE

            topic_info: 0006F41D

                No. Knowing they could never defeat the orcs, the priests of Vaermina released what they call "The Miasma," putting everyone to sleep.

                I'm concerned that when this place is unsealed, the Miasma will dissipate and they'll awaken; both orcs and priests alike.

                Yes. The Torpor grants an ability the priests of Vaermina called "The Dreamstride"; using dreams to travel distances in the real world.

                As a sworn priest of Mara, the elixir won't work for me. The Torpor will only work for Priests of Vaermina, or the unaffiliated.

                I'm selling the best mead in town for cheap. Interested?

                Seeing the sorry state of this city almost makes me regret my decision to leave my home when my apprenticeship completed.

                I was fortunate enough to be guided by one of Silvenar's master armorers until he passed.

                On his deathbed, my master urged me to take over his business but I decided against it. I chose to wander Tamriel instead.

                Hello. Welcome to the Pawned Prawn.
            topic_info: 000D82C7 
                If there's anything you need, I'd be glad to help you.
            topic_info: 000D82C8 
                My husband Bersi will be the death of me. He spends too much time worrying about Riften and not enough about himself.
            topic_info: 0004230F 
                All the crime and corruption in Riften is really getting to him... and now that we hear rumors about the dragons, he's been very depressed.
            topic_info: 0004230E 
                Bersi's afraid that someone's making a move to take the Pawned Prawn from us. I think he's being paranoid.
            topic_info: 0004230D 
                We both own the Pawned Prawn together, but he's singlehandedly kept the place running despite all our problems.
            topic_info: 00042310 
                I just care about my husband so much and I hate to see him in this state.

                Once I'm in charge I have bigger aspirations than just Skyrim. I plan to bring Black-Briar Mead to all of Tamriel.

                At this rate, he'll give the entire Riften Fishery away to charity. Then how will I live?
            topic_info: 0004234D 
                Such a waste of time preaching to the poor. If they're that hungry, they should just grow some food or something.
            topic_info: 0004234E 
                I spend every Friday at the fishery, so I know the meaning of hard work. All those forms to fill out and file; it's exhausting!

                Mark my words. If Bolli thinks he's giving all of our wealth away to some poor slob, I'll leave him high and dry.

                And finally, there's Colette. She may be... difficult to get along with, she's very knowledgeable when it comes to Restoration magic.

                I'm working on some very important research, I assure you.
            topic_info: 000365F7 
                The exact nature of my research is a secret, I'm afraid, but it really is quite valuable.
            topic_info: 000365F8

                We have survived difficult times, and are better mages for it. We owe you that, Arch-Mage. Thank you.

                The Eye of Magnus. Here, but lost. Slipped through our grasp. Oh, what we might have learned.
            topic_info: 000C818C 
                I wonder what we could've done with the Eye, had it been put to better use?
            topic_info: 000C818D 
                Have you seen Mirabelle around? I know she's dead, but I thought... Well, I thought she might stop in and say hello anyway.

                You need a book, you talk to me. Otherwise you're going to find yourself in a lot of pain.

                Tolfdir as Master Wizard. Certainly didn't anticipate that.
            topic_info: 000C8198 
                And to think, Mirabelle questioned my allowing you into the College. I can just imagine the look on her face now.

                Mirabelle does a fine job as Master Wizard, I suppose. Still, there's always room for improvement.
            topic_info: 00036605 
                I can't wait to see who succeeds Mirabelle. I've no doubt she'll be promoted to Arch-Mage at some point.
            topic_info: 00036606 
                Certainly a few of my colleagues aren't quite as talented as they'd like to believe.
            topic_info: 00036607 
                Savos Aren is wise beyond his years. He knows real talent when he sees it.
            topic_info: 0002D8CB 
                I'm sure when the time for promotions comes, they'll go to the most deserving mage.
            topic_info: 0002D8CC 
                Don't you think I'd make a wonderful Master Wizard? Maybe even Arch-Mage someday?
            topic_info: 00036608 
                Nasty business with that Ancano fellow. Pity that I was unable to assist, but I was... otherwise occupied.

                Restoration is a perfectly valid school of magic, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise!
            topic_info: 0003660F 
                Why are my research materials constantly disappearing?
            topic_info: 00036610 
                Once again, I have found very insulting notes left in my personal effects. Simply barbaric.
            topic_info: 00036611 
                Just because I don't fit in here is no reason for others to ridicule me behind my back.
            topic_info: 000C819C 
                Ancano is exactly why we're so restrictive about access to the College. We'd all have perished if it weren't for you.
            topic_info: 000C819D 
                I'm sure you've made note of who's been the most helpful during your time here, Arch-Mage.
            topic_info: 000C819E 
                May I just say, it's a pleasure to have you leading the College. Really.
            topic_info: 000C81A7 
                If there's ever any way I can assist you, please let me know.
            topic_info: 00036612 
                I think the College is due for a change in leadership.

                If you're working on any experiments, please clean up after yourself.

                Just like anywhere else, it's all about who you know. Lucky for you, you know me.
            topic_info: 00036615 
                I hope I can count on you if I ever need a favor.
            topic_info: 0002D8CD 
                It's a small group of us here at the College. Favors don't go unremembered. Neither do affronts.

                The Arch-Mage triumphant! The College... Skyrim... All of Tamriel owes you a great debt!

                I'm quite pleased that we're back to business as usual.
            topic_info: 000C81AA 
                Certainly nothing illicit going on here, Arch-Mage. You can be quite sure of that.
            topic_info: 000C81AB 
                Even with the College's laid-back attitude, there are still some things that are off-limits.
            topic_info: 00036617 
                There are some experiments the College frowns on. If they're aware of them, of course.

            topic_info: 0003661C

                Please don't do anything to anger the locals. They don't need additional reasons to hate us.
            topic_info: 00036621 
                It is not the place of the College to become involved in local politics.

                Day-to-day operations are my responsibility, which means if you become a problem, you get sent to me.

                Like it or not, this College is a direct influence on the public's impressions of magic and those that use it.
            topic_info: 0002D8D1 
                It is up to each of us to present ourselves publicly as maturely as possible, and to remain above petty local squabbles.
            topic_info: 000C81DF 
                I still can't believe it. You, the Arch-Mage? Never would have guessed it.
            topic_info: 00037DCA 
                You know, this is one of a very few places where you can receive a real education in the schools of magic.

                Thanks to you, the people of Skyrim will continue to have a place to study magic. Even if most of them resent you for it.

                I never would have suspected that the Eye could be so dangerous. Tolfdir is right, isn't he? Magic really can overwhelm you.
            topic_info: 000C81ED 
                I've certainly learned more here than I ever expected to.

            topic_info: 000C81FA 
                The College is a bit of an oddity in Skyrim. Magic isn't something that's looked upon fondly here.
            topic_info: 00037EC9 
                Nords don't trust magic, or those that use it. Made it difficult for me growing up.

                J'zargo will go wherever he can to learn more. Oblivion itself, if need be.
            topic_info: 00037ECE 
                Khajiit are not known as mages, so J'zargo has much to prove.
            topic_info: 00037ECF 
                J'zargo can learn magic from these men and elves, but they cannot learn to be as dashing as he. J'zargo comes out on top.

            topic_info: 0006FEC1 
                Is it getting hot, or is it just me?

            topic_info: 000730C2 
                Now, let us bury the memory of these dark deeds.
            topic_info: 000730C3 
                Now, so we're clear - this is the last time we talk about this.
            topic_info: 000730C4 
                Now, as far as I'm concerned, none of this ever happened.
            topic_info: 000730C5 
                Now we can both pretend this whole thing never happened.
            topic_info: 000730C6 
                I trust you'll keep your mouth shut about this.
            topic_info: 000730C7 
                Now the whole thing's over and done with. So let's stop talking about it.
            topic_info: 000730C9 
                Now... I trust we'll never have to speak of this again. To anyone.
            topic_info: 000730CA 
                Now I just want to put the whole nasty business behind me.
            topic_info: 000730CB 
                Now we can put this all behind us, hmm?
            topic_info: 000730CC 
                Now we never talk about it again. Got it?
            topic_info: 000730CD 
                Now let's not talk about it anymore, okay?
            topic_info: 000730CE 
                Now... This conversation never happened. Understood?
            topic_info: 000730CF 
                Anyway, it's done. Time to move on.
            topic_info: 000730D0 
                But enough of this. Such things are best forgotten.
            topic_info: 000730D1 
                Now let's just, you know, try to forget any of this ever happened. All right?
            topic_info: 000730D2 
                What happened is between you, me, and Azura. Let's keep it that way.
            topic_info: 000730D3 
                It's done. No more... no more talking about it.
            topic_info: 000730D4 
                Now, let us turn our thoughts to more pleasant matters.
            topic_info: 000730D5 
                Now, let's just pretend this never happened.
            topic_info: 000730D6 
                I hope you'll agree that these dark deeds are best left forgotten...
            topic_info: 000730D7 
                Now, let's pledge never to speak of this again.
            topic_info: 000730D8 
                But let's not talk about it anymore. What's done is done.
            topic_info: 000730D9 
                Now... I don't really want to talk about it anymore. So let's not.
            topic_info: 000730DA 
                Now our business together is done.
            topic_info: 000730DB 
                I trust we'll never need to speak of this again... to anyone.
            topic_info: 000730DC 
                Let's go our separate ways now, hmm?
            topic_info: 000730DD 
                I'm just glad to put all this behind me. So let's never speak of it again, okay?
            topic_info: 000730DE 
                It speaks truthfully.
            topic_info: 000730DF 
                Um... yeah...
            topic_info: 000730E0

                True enough.
            topic_info: 00073101 
                You're correct.
            topic_info: 00073102 
                Yes.
            topic_info: 000A8625 
                It should put on some coverings.
            topic_info: 000A8626 
                You're naked!
            topic_info: 000A8627 
                Put on some clothes, you damned fool.
            topic_info: 000A8628 
                You ought to cover your... unmentionables.
            topic_info: 000A8629 
                Even rags would be preferable to your current wardrobe. Or lack thereof...
            topic_info: 000A862A 
                Careful. They might put you away if you don't at least put on some pants.
            topic_info: 000A862B 
                I've seen enough. Put on some clothes.
            topic_info: 000ADC65 
                What the..?
            topic_info: 000ADC66 
                What are you doing?
            topic_info: 000AB3D3 
                What is the meaning of this?
            topic_info: 000AB3D4 
                What's going on?
            topic_info: 000AB3D5 
                What in the name of the gods are you doing?
            topic_info: 000AB3D6 
                Careful!
            topic_info: 000AB3D7 
                Wait, what are you doing?
            topic_info: 000AB3D8 
                Fool! What do you think you're doing?
            topic_info: 000AB3D9 
                Look... You shouldn't be doing that...
            topic_info: 000AB3DA 
                This is going to end horribly, I just know it.
            topic_info: 000AB3DB 
                Gods help us, this can't end well.
            topic_info: 000AB3DC 
                Magic. Foul magic...
            topic_info: 000AB3DD 
                Oh, someone's going to get hurt, I just know it...
            topic_info: 000AB3DE 
                Damned wizards and their damned magic...
            topic_info: 000AB3DF 
                Oh goodness, someone's going to get killed.
            topic_info: 000AB3E1 
                Whoa, now... ease off on the magic...
            topic_info: 000AB3E2 
                Oh, now, that can't be good...
            topic_info: 000AB3E3 
                Someone stop this fool sorcerer before someone gets killed.
            topic_info: 000AB3E4 
                Ysmir's beard - I don't like the look of this...
            topic_info: 000AB3E5 
                You shouldn't play around with magic like that...
            topic_info: 000AB3E6 
                Mind your tricks, wizard. No need for someone to get hurt...
            topic_info: 000AB3E7 
                I don't know if that's such a good idea...
            topic_info: 000AB3E8 
                Oh, I do not approve at all.
            topic_info: 000AB3E9 
                Oh, no... No, no, no...
            topic_info: 000AB3EA 
                Crazy n'wah - you're trying to get someone killed?
            topic_info: 000AB3EB 
                Oh, great. I'm gonna get killed by a crazy wizard...
            topic_info: 000AB3EC 
                The world's gone mad with sorcerers now, is that it?
            topic_info: 000AB3ED 
                Ah, dangerous...
            topic_info: 000AB3EE 
                I think it's time to leave...
            topic_info: 000AB3EF 
                By Ysmir, this will not end well...
            topic_info: 000AB3F0 
                You're going to get us all killed, you damn fool!
            topic_info: 000AB3F1 
                Oh, now, do be careful...
            topic_info: 000AB3F2 
                Magic. Great.
            topic_info: 000AB3F3 
                Oh, this is not going to end well...
            topic_info: 000AB3F4 
                You there! What are you doing?
            topic_info: 000AB3F5 
                This doesn't look good.
            topic_info: 000ADC67 
                Not now.
            topic_info: 000ADC68 
                I don't want to talk about it.
            topic_info: 000ADC69 
                Not now.
            topic_info: 000ADC6A 
                Please... I... not now...
            topic_info: 000ADC6B 
                Begone. I have no wish to speak to anyone right now.
            topic_info: 000ADC6C 
                Just go away, please.
            topic_info: 000ADC6D 
                Not now.
            topic_info: 000ADC6E 
                Have the decency to leave me to my sorrows.
            topic_info: 000ADC6F 
                Not now, please.
            topic_info: 000ADC70 
                Not now.
            topic_info: 000ADC71 
                Get out of here.... I'm in no mood to talk...
            topic_info: 000ADC72 
                Leave me alone. Can't you see I'm upset?
            topic_info: 000ADC73 
                Not now. I'm... much too upset to talk.
            topic_info: 000ADC74 
                Go on, leave me alone...
            topic_info: 000ADC75 
                Not now. I'm too upset to talk.
            topic_info: 000ADC77 
                I'm too upset to talk....
            topic_info: 000ADC78 
                Please, I can't... Just... just go.
            topic_info: 000ADC79 
                Go away.
            topic_info: 000ADC7A 
                Leave me.

                Not now.
            topic_info: 000ADC7D 
                I can't talk now.
            topic_info: 000ADC7E 
                Now is not a good time. Leave me alone.
            topic_info: 000ADC7F 
                Go away... please?
            topic_info: 000ADC80 
                Now is not the time for talk...
            topic_info: 000ADC81 
                I want a drink, not company. Now go.
            topic_info: 000ADC82 
                I'm in no mood for conversation. Now go, and leave me be.
            topic_info: 000ADC83 
                Not now, please. I'm just... too upset to talk.
            topic_info: 000ADC84 
                Go away.
            topic_info: 000ADC85 
                Let me stew. Alone.
            topic_info: 000ADC86 
                Just... get out of my face. I've got nothing to say.
            topic_info: 000ADC87 
                Please... I... I can't talk to you right now...
            topic_info: 000ADC88 
                Go away. Now.
            topic_info: 000ADC89 
                Leave me alone... I'm in no mood for talking.
            topic_info: 000ADC8A 
                Not now.
            topic_info: 000ADC8B 
                Look... Now's not a good time...
            topic_info: 000DEE8F 
                How are we doing over here?
            topic_info: 000DEE90 
                You want another one of those?
            topic_info: 000DEE91 
                There's plenty more where that came from. Just give a holler.
            topic_info: 000B80A3

                Good evening. I'm Pantea Ateia, the Master Vocalist.
            topic_info: 0002F7F7 
                It's been my honor to perform at the Blue Palace on many occasions. His late lordship was quite the admirer.

                If you ask me, this damned rebellion can't end soon enough. I had to end my tour of Skyrim's courts. Too dangerous too travel.
            topic_info: 0002F7F9 
                To be honest, I simply can't stand some of my students. Only Aia shows true potential for greatness. The rest are just wasting my time.

                I'm Dean of Lute at the Bards College, and no, I don't give private lessons.

                It takes two things to be a good teacher. The first is patience. The second is a firm wooden stick for rapping knuckles.
            topic_info: 0002F7FB 
                Only reason I'm so good with a lute is because I'm old. It takes a lifetime to master.

                You here to apply at the Bards College? Well don't bother - you're too damned old. Start past four, and it's all wasted effort.

                Hello, yes? I'm the Dean of History. And scribe work, when I can find some quiet time.

                My position, "Dean of History," actually covers a wide range of subjects. I teach poetry, writing, history, and the finer points of court life.

                It's an honor to have Viarmo for instruction on drum, but he's far too reserved for my tastes.

                This here's Rorikstead. Quiet place. Good people, though. You can get a room and a mug at the Frostfruit Inn if you care to stay.

                That's the Honningbrew Meadery. Supposed to be a big rivalry between them and the Black-Briars of Riften.
            topic_info: 000E1379 
                Remember when that used to be the Honningbrew Meadery? Didn't stand a chance against those Black-Briars of Riften.
            topic_info: 000DE4E1 
                This is Karthwasten. Mining town. I hear they've had a lot of trouble with the Forsworn.
            topic_info: 000DE4E2 
                This here's the Darkwater. Comes down from Lake Honrich into the White River, a few miles downstream. Good fishing, I hear.

                Morthal, capital of Hjaalmarch hold. Not quite in the same league as Solitude or Whiterun, but a nice enough place if you like swamps.
            topic_info: 000DFB09 
                Here we are. Dawnstar. Capital of the Pale. Don't get up this way much. Beautiful country though.

                I can't say I've been to Winterhold more than a handful of times. Can't see much reason most honest folk would want to come up here.

                Well, this is Falkreath. Not much to look at if you're used to the bigger cities, but the folk here are friendly enough if you give them a chance.
            topic_info: 000DE4E3 
                The Braidwood Inn's up that way. I know the innkeeper - Iddra. Nice lady.

                Shor's Stone - pissant little town, not even an inn. Just a bunch of miners scratching in the dirt.

                Magic is nothing but trouble. If you're set on it, there's that College in Winterhold or Ulfric's court wizard. But don't say I didn't warn you.

            topic_info: 0003708E 
                It's... in a hollowed-out rock. In the tundra. A bit west of Whiterun. Now please... please stop.
            topic_info: 0003708F 
                Oh gods, you've taken everything I have. Just kill me and be done with it...

            topic_info: 00037164 
                It's in a hollowed-out tree stump. In the marsh, south of Solitude. Now please, you'll let me go now. Right?

                Why don't you be a dear and let me go now. All right? I won't say a word to anyone. Our little secret. I promise.

            topic_info: 000371B5 
                Ha! Well it's safely hidden away, in a hollowed-out tree stump. Just outside Riften, tucked away nice and secure. You'll never find it.
            topic_info: 000371B6 
                Damn it. I gave it away, didn't I?

                We need to stem the flow of silver to the rebellion. Until we retake the Reach, the Stormcloaks will plunder it's mines to fund further violence.

                Ulfric will want to take Whiterun from us. But we will hold fast. We can't give the rebellion free reign through the center of Skyrim.

                By holding onto Falkreath, we control access to the Reach, Whiterun, and the Rift. Ulfric will try for it soon. We'll be there to stop him.
            topic_info: 000A6D42 
                I fear losing Falkreath may give too much advantage to Ulfric. The rebels now control access to the Reach, Whiterun, and the Rift. I want it back.
            topic_info: 000A6D43 
                Taking the Pale gives us another port in Dawnstar, and puts us within striking distance of Windhelm. That should make Ulfric a bit more cautious, eh?
            topic_info: 000A6D44 
                Controlling the Pale gives Ulfric a port town and takes the pressure off of Windhelm. But it's only a matter of time before it's back in our hands.

                There's not much up there, but if we can regain Winterhold, our proximity to Windhelm should keep Ulfric wary and wasting troops garrisoned at home.
            topic_info: 000A6D47 
                I almost can't believe it's over. The rebellion is squashed, Windhelm is free. I must admit, Ulfric put up a stronger fight than I was expecting.
            topic_info: 000A6D48 
                We will oust Ulfric from Windhelm soon enough. And when we do, I'll have his head on a plate.

                Taking control of the Rift was a great victory. Ulfric must be rather nervous with us so close to his door step.
            topic_info: 000A6D4A 
                We need the Rift. We need to regain control of it before we can march on Windhelm without worry about our rear guard.

                I'm proud we liberated Falkreath from the Empire. In many ways it's the heart and soul of Skyrim. Not to mention its rather strategic position.
            topic_info: 000A6D5A 
                The Empire thinks it holds Falkreath from us. But the souls of Skyrim's bravest are buried there and will fill our hearts and strengthen our blades.
            topic_info: 000A6D94 
                Tullius has camps in the Pale, entertaining thoughts of battle. The Empire still underestimates the force of our cause. It will be their undoing.
            topic_info: 000A6D9A 
                I can't believe we let them take the Pale. Losing the port of Dawnstar is lessened only by the threat of Imperial forces being so close to Windhelm.
            topic_info: 000A6DA1 
                I'm not sure why Tullius is wasting his time trying to take Winterhold from us. But if he wants to throw his men away, I'll gladly accept that gift.
            topic_info: 000A6E20 
                I don't like Imperial troops holed up in Winterhold... such a close march to Windhelm. So I'm sending a campaign up there to take it back.
            topic_info: 000A6E2C 
                Damn Tullius. He's pocketed men in the Rift. It's dangerous having Imperials skulking about on the southern border of Eastmarch.

            topic_info: 00067DDD 
                First off, there's a couple of Imperials skulking about the hold. Need to cut their throats so they can't make their reports.
            topic_info: 000221E4 
                First off, they've got some rebels holed up in a nearby settlement. Need to clean them out so our boys can move in.
            topic_info: 00017DD0 
                First off, there's a band of Imperials hiding in a nearby village. We're going to flush them out and put them to the sword.
            topic_info: 000221E5 
                First, we need to limit Stormcloak capacity and send them a not so subtle message by sabotaging a resource they claim to control.
            topic_info: 00017DD1 
                First problem here is a pack of Imperial dogs drooling over resources stolen from the people. A little sabotage will sour the taste of that victory.
            topic_info: 000221E6 
                First, we have information regarding the movements of a rebel courier. We need to intercept him and confiscate his package.
            topic_info: 00017DD2 
                First, we've learnt the whereabouts of an Imperial cur fetching documents for his master in Solitude. We need to put a muzzle on that, don't we?
            topic_info: 0002F57F 
                First of all, one of our men was captured by rebels who refuse to surrender him. So we're going to break him out.
            topic_info: 00017DD3 
                First of all, a son of Skyrim rots in an Imperial prison. We'll be getting him out of there soon.
            topic_info: 00015490 
                First of all, I need to sew confusion and doubt through the rebel troops. I want to assassinate their commanding officer.
            topic_info: 00037B03 
                First, if we can assassinate their commander, we'll be able to strike them while they're busy tucking their tails between their legs.
            topic_info: 00037B04 
                First, our intelligence suggests one of the rebel garrisons has become disaffected. If we play our cards right, we should be able to turn them.
            topic_info: 00017DD4 
                First off, we hear a group of Imperial legionnaires are coming around to our way of thinking. With a little encouragement they'll join our side.
            topic_info: 0004AFA7 
                First off, seems the Jarl's Steward might be vulnerable to blackmail. Need to investigate that possibility.
            topic_info: 0004AFA8 
                First off, it seems that we might be able to blackmail the Jarl's Steward. I need to find out for sure.
            topic_info: 000504E8 
                First on my list, is a problem with our supply caravans being constantly harassed by a giant. Need to deal with that hairy brute. And soon.

                The last few supply caravans have been attacked... by a giant. As if I didn't have enough to deal with. Need that damn hairy brute straightened out.
            topic_info: 00051090 
                First, I need to get a handle on rebel operations. Need to discretely liberate some documents from their headquarters.
            topic_info: 00051091 
                First, I need to know what the Imperials are planning. Need to slip into their headquarters, grab plans, maps, something useful like that.
            topic_info: 00090E9F 
                First of all, I'd like to drum up some more support from the local populace. I have someone in mind.
            topic_info: 00090EA0 
                First of all, there's someone in particular I'd like to win over to our cause.
            topic_info: 0008F341 
                First off, there's an Orc hanging around causing me headaches. Something about a vision quest he needs help with.
            topic_info: 0008F342 
                First off, there's a damn Orc hanging around getting in the way. He's been yammering on about needing help with some kind of vision quest.

            topic_info: 00067DDB 
                Secondly, we got a couple of Imperial spies roaming through the hold. Need to put an end to that.
            topic_info: 000221E8 
                Secondly, we got more of 'em hiding in a village, using the local populace as shields. Not to worry. We can dispatch them without harming the locals.
            topic_info: 00017DC0 
                Secondly, we plan on liberating a settlement from Imperial hands.
            topic_info: 000221E9 
                Secondly, I need to cripple rebel production capabilities with a little sabotage.
            topic_info: 00017DC1 
                Next problem - Imperial thieves have, yet again, stolen an important resource.  So we're gonna take it from them permanently - by destroying it.
            topic_info: 000221EA 
                Soldiers win wars, but where to put them is the key. We have word of an enemy courier in the area. We aim to confiscate his documents.
            topic_info: 00017DC2 
                And then, it seems an Imperial worm wiggles it's way back home, carrying information stolen from us. We need to steal it back.
            topic_info: 000221E7 
                And perhaps more importantly, I need to break one of our boys out of a rebel controlled fort.
            topic_info: 00017DC3 
                And perhaps more importantly, we have a brother rotting in an Imperial prison. He won't languish in there long, will he now?
            topic_info: 00015494 
                And we have an opportunity to slay the rebel field commander. Without a clear command structure, they should fall into confusion and disarray.
            topic_info: 00017DC4 
                We also have the opportunity to slay an Imperial Legate. That'll put fear and confusion into those faithless dogs.
            topic_info: 00037AD9 
                And we understand a rebel garrison is close to abandoning the resistance. We need to send them a little encouragement.
            topic_info: 00037AEE 
                And we hear a handful of Imperials are realizing they are Stormcloaks at heart. We need to send them a little encouragement.
            topic_info: 0004AFA1 
                Next, I need a little investigating to confirm the possibility of blackmailing the Jarl's Steward.
            topic_info: 0004AFA2 
                Next, I need dirt on the Jarl's Steward. Heard there's blackmail potential there.
            topic_info: 000504EA 
                And then there's a tiny problem with a giant that's been raiding our supply caravans... You heard me right. A giant. Need to put a stop to that.
            topic_info: 000504EB 
                And then there's a tiny problem with a giant attacking our supply caravans. A giant! As if I didn't have enough to deal with.

                I also would like to get a handle on what the rebels are planning - slip into their headquarters and steal their war plans.
            topic_info: 00051099 
                Also, I need a peek inside Imperial headquarters, ideally lifting some documents detailing their plans. I need to know what to concentrate on.
            topic_info: 00090EA5 
                Then there's a little matter of some recruiting. I have someone in mind I'd like to join our campaign.
            topic_info: 00090EA6 
                I need to send someone out to do a little recruiting. There's someone in particular I'd like to join us.

            topic_info: 000A1FA0 
                Secondly, we're mounting an attack on the Fort. I want to gain a fortified position here before we launch our final attack on the capital.
            topic_info: 000A1FA1 
                Secondly, I want to take the fort here. Having a fortified position will make it easier for us to amass men for our ultimate attack on the capital.

                Excellent. I can move more soldiers through the area now that I know those scouts are dead.
            topic_info: 000674D3 
                Good job! With those Imperial scouts out of the way, I can be more aggressive about where I send our men.
            topic_info: 00058095 
                You gave those mongrels a real whipping, eh? Good work. We'll be sure to send a garrison to reinforce the area and keep the peace.
            topic_info: 00058096 
                Excellent! We've hit 'em where it hurts. Repairs will be needed when we take over, but at least the Stormcloaks won't benefit in the meantime.
            topic_info: 00058097 
                We hit 'em where it hurts. As soon as we can, we'll take over - make the needed repairs. In the meantime, the people no longer slave for the Empire.

                You made it! I'm impressed. It was a gamble, but turned out well.

                You're alive! It was a gamble - but as Talos keeps us, we keep each other - I wasn't going to just let them rot in there.
            topic_info: 0005809A 
                Good. They'll think twice before crossing us while their command structure is in disarray.
            topic_info: 0005809B 
                I pray Talos overlooks our less than honorable approach. But he knows our purpose is just and true. I'm glad you made it out alive.
            topic_info: 0005809C 
                Good work. This was a double victory. We took a garrison away from the Stormcloaks and further proved the hollowness of their cause.
            topic_info: 0005809D 
                Excellent. That's one less settlement in Imperial hands, and one more sign to all that our cause is true.
            topic_info: 00050932 
                Good work. I'll send some men with a wagon to collect the prize. We can use the weapons here, and I'll pass on the coin to Solitude.
            topic_info: 00050933 
                Well done! I'll send men with a wagon to collect our prize. We'll put the weapons to use here, and I'll send the coin back to Windhelm.

                Good job. The more citizens that join the fight against the rebels, the sooner they will see the futility of their rebellion.

                We grow that much stronger with each son and daughter of Skyrim who joins us. Down with the Emperor!

                Thanks for taking care of that. I don't think that will be the last we see of that Orc. It's always good to gain allies.

                Thanks for dealing with that orc. Something tells me that's not the last time we'll see him. And, something tells me that might not be a bad thing.

                Taking the Pale gives us another port in Dawnstar, and puts us within striking distance of Windhelm. That should make Ulfric a bit more cautious, eh?

                I almost can't believe it's over. The rebellion is squashed, Windhelm is free. I must admit, Ulfric put up a stronger fight than I was expecting.

                Taking control of the Rift was a great victory. Ulfric must be rather nervous with us so close to his door step.

                By taking back Falkreath, we control access to the Reach, Whiterun, and the Rift. We should never have given it up.

                Reclaiming Hjaalmarch lets me worry less about the rear guard, and push more men to the front. It was a mistake to let Ulfric control it for so long.
            topic_info: 000E6C4A 
                It was important we reclaimed the Reach. Letting Ulfric control the flow of silver was a mistake. One I'm glad we've finally corrected.

            topic_info: 000A6CB1 
                We need to stem the flow of silver to the rebellion. Until we retake the Reach, the Stormcloaks will plunder it's mines to fund further violence.

                Hjaalmarch is an important buffer zone between the rebel forces and the capital. Ulfric will try to break through at some point.
            topic_info: 000E6C7E 
                Reclaiming Hjaalmarch lets me worry less about the rear guard, and push more men to the front. It was a mistake to let Ulfric control it for so long.
            topic_info: 000A6CB3 
                I'm losing my patience with this damn war. We must take Hjaalmarch back! The Stormcloaks will be beating upon the doors of the capital soon.
            topic_info: 000A6CB4 
                Ulfric will want to take Whiterun from us. But we will hold fast. We can't give the rebellion free reign through the center of Skyrim.
            topic_info: 000A6CB5 
                I can't believe we lost Whiterun. The rebels have a great advantage in controlling the center now. We must take it back!
            topic_info: 000A6CB6 
                By holding onto Falkreath, we control access to the Reach, Whiterun, and the Rift. Ulfric will try for it soon. We'll be there to stop him.
            topic_info: 000E6C82 
                By taking back Falkreath, we control access to the Reach, Whiterun, and the Rift. We should never have given it up.
            topic_info: 000A6CB7 
                I fear losing Falkreath may give too much advantage to Ulfric. The rebels now control access to the Reach, Whiterun, and the Rift. I want it back.
            topic_info: 000A6CB8 
                Taking the Pale gives us another port in Dawnstar, and puts us within striking distance of Windhelm. That should make Ulfric a bit more cautious, eh?
            topic_info: 000A6CB9 
                Controlling the Pale gives Ulfric a port town and takes the pressure off of Windhelm. But it's only a matter of time before it's back in our hands.

                Now that we have Winterhold, I can garrison some troops there until I'm ready to march on Windhelm.
            topic_info: 000A6CBB 
                There's not much up there, but if we can regain Winterhold, our proximity to Windhelm should keep Ulfric wary and wasting troops garrisoned at home.
            topic_info: 000A6CBC 
                I almost can't believe it's over. The rebellion is squashed, Windhelm is free. I must admit, Ulfric put up a stronger fight than I was expecting.
            topic_info: 000A6CBD 
                We will oust Ulfric from Windhelm soon enough. And when we do, I'll have his head on a plate.

                Taking control of the Rift was a great victory. Ulfric must be rather nervous with us so close to his door step.

                We need the Rift. We need to regain control of it before we can march on Windhelm without worry about our rear guard.

                Tullius must be getting nervous. Taking Hjaalmarch we're practically in his backyard now. As soon as we're able, we'll march on Solitude.
            topic_info: 000A6CC5 
                We should take Hjaalmarch. It'll be an important pressure point on the Imperials. We'd be within spitting distance of the capital.

                We've driven the Imperials out of Whiterun. This is good. Very good. We now control the center. It's a powerful position. One I aim to keep.

                Tullius has camps in the Pale, entertaining thoughts of battle. The Empire still underestimates the force of our cause. It will be their undoing.

                I'm glad we've finally restored the Pale. It was extremely foolish giving the Empire control of another port.
            topic_info: 000A6CCB 
                I can't believe we let them take the Pale. Losing the port of Dawnstar is lessened only by the threat of Imperial forces being so close to Windhelm.
            topic_info: 000A6CCC 
                I'm not sure why Tullius is wasting his time trying to take Winterhold from us. But if he wants to throw his men away, I'll gladly accept that gift.
            topic_info: 000E6C84 
                I'm glad we've taken back Winterhold. While the Imperials were up there, important resources were tied up stiffening our northern border.

                I don't like Imperial troops holed up in Winterhold... such a close march to Windhelm. So I'm sending a campaign up there to take it back.

                Damn Tullius. He's pocketed men in the Rift. It's dangerous having Imperials skulking about on the southern border of Eastmarch.

                What are you doing that for?
            topic_info: 00039C37 
                You could have just asked.
            topic_info: 00039C38 
                I saw you do that, you know.

                Help yourself, by all means. Who cares if I starve?

                Don't worry about it. Keep it.
            topic_info: 00039C3A 
                I guess you can have that.
            topic_info: 000D360C 
                You must really need that.
            topic_info: 000D3E93 
                I'll look the other way this time.
            topic_info: 0006AE43 
                I didn't really want that anyway.
            topic_info: 000D3E94 
                I suppose that's yours now.
            topic_info: 00039C3B 
                Oh, what a clever thief you are.
            topic_info: 00091708 
                You could have asked before just taking it.
            topic_info: 0006CE33 
                You could have just asked.
            topic_info: 0006CE3C

            topic_info: 00039C3C 
                You really shouldn't be in here, but I guess since it's you...
            topic_info: 00039C3D 
                I'll let you stay. This time.
            topic_info: 0006AE40 
                If you were anyone else, I'd make you leave.
            topic_info: 0006AE41 
                You're not really supposed to... you know, be here.
            topic_info: 00039C3E 
                You know you're not supposed to be in here right now.

                You're not really allowed in here, you know.

                Dragons breathing fire in the sky. Vampires brazenly attacking people on the street. It's the end of the world I tell you.

                They say if a vampire so much as scratches you, you'll turn into one. That better not be true.

            topic_info: 020126C1 
                Changed your mind, huh? The Dawnguard could use somebody like you.

                Report to Isran at Fort Dawnguard. And get moving if you're serious about it. The vampires aren't going to wait around to make their next move.
            topic_info: 0200D057 
                Heard they're reforming the Dawnguard. Vampire hunters or something, in the old fort near Riften. Might consider joining up myself.

                They say that vampires attacked the Hall of the Vigilant. Burned it to the ground! Never heard of vampires doing anything like that before.

                It's not safe out there. Horrible creatures attacking towns in the night... If they won't let me in, at least I can stay here.
            topic_info: 02019910 
                Look at the size of that fort. They must have room for a few more in there.
            topic_info: 02019911 
                I worry it'll never be safe to go home.

                I hope Alvide doesn't think less of me, but I can't protect her on my own. We're safer here.

                Why can't they just let us in? We won't get in the way!

                I've no love for living out of a tent, but I'll take that over being ripped apart.
            topic_info: 02019916 
                It looks like this is as close as we're going to get being safe from the vampires.
            topic_info: 02019917 
                Barknar insisted we come here, said we'd be safe. He also said we'd be inside the walls.
            topic_info: 02019918 
                What if the vampires come here, after the Dawnguard? We'll be stuck right in the middle.
            topic_info: 02019919 
                I hope we can go home soon. I don't like it here.
            topic_info: 0201991A 
                At least Barknar and I are here together.
            topic_info: 0201991B 
                Thought I'd come here to be safe. Now they won't so much as let us in.
            topic_info: 0201991C 
                How hard would it be to feed a few extra mouths? I'm sure they can manage, and not leave us sitting out here like cattle.
            topic_info: 0201991D 
                I won't beg for protection, but I'm not even sure that would work with this Isran.
            topic_info: 0201991E 
                Aren't the Dawnguard here to help, to make it safe for us? Can't see why they wouldn't let us in.
